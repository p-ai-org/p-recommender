To prepare students for research methods courses, it focuses on data preparation, analysis and interpretation. The course covers descriptive and inferential statistics, including probability distributions, null hypothesis significance testing, t-tests, analysis of variance, multiple correlation and regression, and non-parametric tests (e.g., Chi-square). Students learn to (1) articulate the nuances and importance of statistics to the real world; (2) critically examine statistical analysis outputs from widely used software in psychology; and (3) analyze, differentiate, and explain statistical results that are applied to behavioral sciences.
