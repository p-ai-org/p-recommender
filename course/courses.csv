AFRI010A AF-01,Intro to Africana Studies    ,"This class will serve as a general introduction to Africana Studies. Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.

Our objective is twofold: first, to explore the autobiographical practices of Black women and the arcs of their lives, approaching autobiographies as both creative works of art and historical documents. Secondly, we will analyze Black women's autobiographies as models of the diverse ways available for writing one's autobiography. The course will equip students to conduct close readings, engage in verbal and written analysis of creative texts, and prepare students to examine the lives of others as stimuli for examining and representing their own.","Finley, J",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

Wokeness is a term created by African Americans and often used as a hashtag in piecemeal ways by
mainstream society. In this course, we will challenge the idea of what wokeness means, its early derivatives, and its true definition by examining mostly early 20th century to more contemporary African American contributors to sociology such as St. Clair Drake,
Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being ""woke"" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding.

How did the current international system come about and why does it look the way it does? What are the central institutions and structures that shape global politics and how do they operate? And how should we make sense of the numerous ?global? issues facing states and societies? To answer these questions, this course will highlight a diverse range of approaches to understanding global politics-- including mainstream, interpretivist, post-/ de-colonial, non-Western, and indigenous perspectives-- as well as core concepts, such as the state, sovereignty, and power. We will put these concepts and perspectives to use in order to make sense of a number of contemporary issues in global politics, including identity and difference, international order, climate change, migration, violence and security, and human rights, paying special attention to the role of imperialism and colonialism in making global politics what it is today.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail?

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Often these narratives of progress overshadow the lived experiences of people on the ground. This course introduces students to the historical and political underpinnings that have led us to understand development as economic growth. Using anthropological critiques of the idea of development, this course helps students to challenge the meanings ascribed to development by foregrounding the experiences of communities (often marginalized by virtue of their status as low-income or indigenous, or because of their gender, race and ethnicity) whose lives are impacted by development projects. This course sheds light on the need to view development with a critical lens and the pressing need to think of alternatives to dominant models of development as economic growth.

ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

HIST131C CM-01,Crusading Mentalities    ,"This seminar explores the causes, meanings, meaningfulness and commemoration of new religious identities shaped by war: from the reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula, to the new heretics in Central Europe and clashes between Latin and Orthodox Christians in Constantinople; and from contentious labels of heretic, Jew, infidel and pagan, to new institutional mechanisms for defining cultural difference around the Mediterranean. The course objective is to understand how a series of events in medieval history that shaped medieval culture led to the invention of a violent paradigm of Islamic-Christian relations intended to mask internal social and religious divisions, and continues to shape the rhetoric of cultural encounter that divides our world today.","Ferguson, Heather",CM Campus,11:00AM-12:15PM.

HIST154  CM-01,Makers of Modern India/Pakistan    ,"This course focuses on Gandhi, Jinnah and Nehru, and looks at a dozen other important leaders of the 19th and 20th centuries in South Asia. We are interested in two groups of questions. The first includes: what about the social, economic, political and intellectual contexts of the period produced leaders like these? How are leaders created in modern South Asia? Who is excluded? The second cluster includes: what kind of a new nation did these leaders wish to create? What were the creative impulses in their vision? What were the limitations? We will read original works by these and other leaders and sift through the most important interpretations of their leadership. Satisfies a breadth requirement in the Leadership Sequence.","Panda, Ahona",CM Campus,01:15-02:30PM.  RS Room 105 (Roberts South),TR
HIST158  CM-01,Japanese Empire    ,"Following the Meiji Ishin (1868), Japan became an imperial power as it seized territories and resources in various parts of East Asia. By the start of the Pacific War in December 1941, Japan had become one of the largest imperial powers in Asia with its colonization of Taiwan and Korea, control of vast parts of southern China and establishment of the puppet regime of Manchukuo (Manchuria). This class looks at how Japan became an imperial power in East Asia and how this development impacted those affected by Japanese rule, including Korea, China, Taiwan, and Manchuria. In particular, the class seeks to trace why and how people in Korea, China, Taiwan, and Manchuria sought to forge new ideologies, customs, and practices to not only deal with Japanese imperialism, but also modernity.

We will use feminist approaches to discuss how 'women' and feminity, and 'men' and masculinity are produced.  After a quick survey of South Asian history to locate gender, we will look at three specific problems areas:  how the state and its legal system apportion power to women and men; how education works to produce different gender identities; and how in the arts the human body is differently used and interpreted, and experiences and emotions become gendered.","Panda, Ahona",CM Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

HIST173  CM-01,Global Borderlands    ,"What are the historical processes that have constructed the porous, contested spaces known as borderlands? Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship. Students develop an original historical research paper using the theoretical and methodological approaches introduced in class. Previous coursework in History strongly advised.

HIST107  CM-01,Ancient & Medieval Historians    ,"Works surviving from the great historians of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean populate the imagination with impressions of distant worlds. But to what extent do these impressions depend on how authors chose to tailor past events to a contemporary political and social background? To what extent did the 'great histories' interact with competing versions of the past? This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours and Bede. Continuities and differences in the historical portrayal of such themes as politics, violence, gender and religion will receive particular attention.

The class will explore how colonial regimes worked aggressively to police those racial lines. Yet, we will also consider how relations between and among those groups challenged and altered these racial constructs. This will culminate in an overall discussion on the evolution of modern racial attitudes.

By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of ""Latino/a"" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically.

This course offers a solid introduction to Caribbean-origin Latina literature. Our engagement with literary renderings of the Latina experience will be informed by a recurrent emphasis on representations of history and issues of gender, terms that can be understood culturally, historically, economically, racially, and geographically. Writers seeking to reflect and inform the US immigrant experience have seized on the expressive and critical power of memoir, Bildungsromane, historical fiction, and revolution narratives. Reading the literature of Latinas of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin will show us how immigration and cicular migration inform issues of gender, sexuality, maternity, and reproduction.

EA  099  PO-01,Urban Health Equity    ,"Where you live impacts how well and how long you live. Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.","Douglass-Jaimes, Guillermo",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

CSCI049D HM-01,CS Studio  / Special Topics in Computer Sci  ,"CS Studio is a studio-type seminar whose raw material is an external project with a significant computational component. Each student joins or brings such a project and, through CS Studio, materially advances its goals by understanding, analyzing, exploring, designing, and implementing new computational capabilities. Equally important are assessment, testing, and iterating across this computing workflow. 

CS Studio's purpose is that each student build skillsets, toolsets, and experience-sets they will bring to future computing challenges. Even as specific technologies vary widely, every CS Studio student will practice (1) exploratory drafting, i.e., exemplifying system behavior outside its context, (2) conceptual shoring, i.e., intentionally pushing beyond a system-as-envisioned to expand on goals, possibilities, and limits, and (3) teamwork-computing: software is communal, and even solo projects benefit from - and depend on - their communities' computational models.

CS Studio can be taken twice, for up to three HMC units of credit. It is not a cs-major elective.

ENGL010  PO-01,Introduction to Close Reading    ,"This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as ""close reading.""  Close reading begins, not with the question, ""What do these words mean?"" but instead, the question, ""What do these words say?""  And then, ""What if these words mean just what they say?""  And then, ""What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).

ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

ENGL170K PO-01,The Canterbury Tales    ,"Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

As part of our investigation into the asymmetrical distribution of toxins and environmental fallout across different populations, students will not only grapple with biopolitical theory but also look to a range of cultural texts - from science fiction films to contemporary fiction to graphic art - to consider alternative political assemblages and strategies for survival that arise from gender and ethnic studies frameworks.

In this class, ""trans"" will act as an umbrella (if a potentially insufficient one) for multiple modalities of gender-nonnormativity, including transgender, nonbinary, intersex, and Two-Spirit identities. We will discuss how gender-variance enables contestations of colonial-imperial and racializing ideologies of gender. To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship. Given trans studies' critiques of academic disciplinarity and nation-based analytical frameworks, this course will embrace transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches.

connects us to one another, to our families, cultures, and histories. It is a major part of our economy - every day of our lives is
impacted by food system workers. Today, the increased availability of cheaper food, larger portion sizes, the reliance on high calorie,
processed ingredients, the types of food available in many communities, government policies, and lifestyle choices have led to an
epidemic of food-related health problems. At the same time, many Americans struggle with food insecurity due to wage stagnation
and economic disruptions. Food systems are both major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly vulnerable to
climate change. The sustainability of human civilization hinges on the resilience of our food systems. In this course, we develop an indepth understanding of food systems - the people, processes, and resources that move our food from farm and ocean to plate.

EA  099  PO-01,Urban Health Equity    ,"Where you live impacts how well and how long you live. Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.","Douglass-Jaimes, Guillermo",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

By tracing stories of crises across genres and disciplinesfrom science fiction to science articleswe will explore how apocalyptic and dystopic modes of thinking shape the ways we imagine our environment and ourselves. As we survey catastrophes from the atomic bomb to climate change, we will ask: What is the relationship between storytelling and science? How can art and literature enable us to imagine more resilient, just futures? In exploring such questions, our class will unearth systems of power embedded within narratives of environmental crises as we tackle questions of intergenerational and environmental justice.

Ultimately, our analyses of understanding and dismantling racism will not only shed light on the complexities of a variety of issues such as racial identities and social structures but will also deepen our understanding of the role of social psychology in our lives.","Gampa, Anup",HM Campus,01:15-04:00PM.

RLST112  HM-01,Engaging Religion    ,"This advanced-level seminar uses case studies to explore what counts as religion in a variety of contexts: media, law, academia, economics, politics, etc.  How do people recognize religion?  What consequences are there for recognizing or denying the legitimacy of religious practices or beliefs? How is that legitimacy judged?  How is it narrated?  By approaching a few case studies from multiple perspectives, students gain insight into how the lenses used to assess religion can enable, deepen or limit understanding.

Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship. Students develop an original historical research paper using the theoretical and methodological approaches introduced in class. Previous coursework in History strongly advised.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965.

We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that ""bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison."" The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as ""Permission of Instructor Required"" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.  State ID and/or passport required.

Students will be leaving campus at 4:30pm and returning at 9:30pm, although there is a Zoom option. Students do not need any prior experience tutoring to be in this course. ","Drake, Kimberly",SC Campus,06:00-09:00PM.  ARR  (Arranged Location),T

ENGL170K PO-01,The Canterbury Tales    ,"Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

This semiotic history is in turn grounded in popular literature and popular culture, especially visual culture, and cinema.  We will read conspiracy narratives in two different ways, that is as cultural historians (materialist and historical) with reference to film (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Four Feathers, The Matrix), literature (The Secret Agent, The Crying of Lot 49) and popular culture (eGames). We will also look at conspiracy texts through four hermeneutic terms: lost cause (and Lost Cause with the objet petit a), foreclosure (forclusion), ressentiment (paranoia and castration), and information (knowledge).","Long, Andrew C.",PO Campus,01:15-02:30PM.

More than presenting a series of individual case studies, we seek and forge pathways of understanding across time period and national divide, to articulate ways in which queerness?here broadly defined as the experience of 'otherness' in gender or sexual identity relative to societal expectations?inevitably enlivens and drives forward the very cultures and characters that ostensibly serve to suppress it. In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

Among the rangeof approaches that study these initiatives, the field ofâindigenous feminismâhas remained an era of contention among indigenous and non-indigenous scholars as well as activists. The course will focus on how current emancipatory thought and practice led by indigenous women has challenged that the ethnocentric andhomogenizing assumptions embedded in certain critical perspectives and feminist traditions. This course will explore a broad range of interdisciplinary theories and studies (across the social sciences and humanities)as well as literary and cinematic representations that have shaped leadership and cultural analysis for indigenous women in Latin America, specifically Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. Along with representation of indigenous peoples by non-indigenous critics or authors, we will also study initiatives of self-representations in testimonio and films in order to analyze how the use of different media hasbecome a key factor for conveying memories of struggle and for the ongoing reformulation of past legacies in the context of the neoliberal era.

SPAN163  SC-01,Pais Vasco or Euskal Herria    ,"Basque people (euskaldunak) are considered one of the oldest indigenous ethnic groups of Europe; its language is a mystery. Most Basques live in seven historical territories and speak Spanish, French, and Euskara. The aim of this course is to introduce students to Basque culture from a historical, linguistic, anthropological, political and artistic perspective. As one of the most unique regions of Spain, it provides a fertile ground to analyze decentralized forms of knowledge. We will tackle issues such a nation/nation state, ethnicity and identity politics; sexualities and gender, tradition and modernity. The course will also examine Basques in the American diaspora.

will follow a case study approach, centering on how ethics are applied within broad categories: science and technology; finance, business, and society; and the global world with its divisions and distinctions. People in all sorts of organizations
need to articulate what ethics are and to set up guidelines, since these do not just fall into place naturally. They must be intellectually constructed, hence the title, âethical constructs.â","Jensen, Jill",PZ Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),W

In contrast to generalist tutoring that takes place in a writing center or otherwise outside of a classroom, with a tutor who works from a position of unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the essays they tutor, this kind of tutoring presumes specialization and familiarity. It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that ""bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison."" The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as ""Permission of Instructor Required"" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.

ENGL010  PO-01,Introduction to Close Reading    ,"This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as ""close reading.""  Close reading begins, not with the question, ""What do these words mean?"" but instead, the question, ""What do these words say?""  And then, ""What if these words mean just what they say?""  And then, ""What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).

ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

ENGL170K PO-01,The Canterbury Tales    ,"Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

What does it mean to live the good life; to never experience lack or scarcity and to be surrounded by plenty? Can human societies realize such edenic conditions without the toil, labor, and suffering of others? How can a no-place be an ideal place? Is the ideal place for some people an injurious place for others? In addition to examining these questions, we will consider how political and critical theory bleed into utopian/dystopian texts, while also reflecting on how these texts interrogate and challenge those theories.

This semiotic history is in turn grounded in popular literature and popular culture, especially visual culture, and cinema.  We will read conspiracy narratives in two different ways, that is as cultural historians (materialist and historical) with reference to film (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Four Feathers, The Matrix), literature (The Secret Agent, The Crying of Lot 49) and popular culture (eGames).

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics.

By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of ""Latino/a"" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically.

This course offers a solid introduction to Caribbean-origin Latina literature. Our engagement with literary renderings of the Latina experience will be informed by a recurrent emphasis on representations of history and issues of gender, terms that can be understood culturally, historically, economically, racially, and geographically. Writers seeking to reflect and inform the US immigrant experience have seized on the expressive and critical power of memoir, Bildungsromane, historical fiction, and revolution narratives. Reading the literature of Latinas of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin will show us how immigration and cicular migration inform issues of gender, sexuality, maternity, and reproduction.

To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship.

the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are

German Idealism, from Kant to Hegel - nihilism and the crisis of reason. The context is increasing unease that Enlightenment reason would destroy traditional religion, in favor Spinoza's monism: all things are one, no transcendent God, no creation. Or in favor of skepticism about everything. Or in favor of what was then dubbed ""nihilism."" Kant's critique of reason is a moderating reform. Jacobi's is a more radical subordination of rational demonstration, prefiguring existentialism and Kierkegaard's ""leap of faith.""

After all, we do not emerge into the world fully formed. Many people in our lives influence the kind of agents we become.

POLI152  PO-01,Political Dialogue & Resistance    ,"Why are some political disputes settled through dialogue and negotiation, while others escalate into protest or even political violence?  How does the process of political engagement affect outcomes?  How is the decision to talk or to fight, and the manner in which one talks or fights - mediated by identity, networks, and culture? And in what ways does past participation in contentious politics affect future political engagement?  This class explores these questions through theoretical readings, case studies from around the world, documentaries, negotiation simulations, and conversations with practitioners.

POLI161  PO-01,Comparative Social Policy    ,"There is a tendency in some corners of American politics to gaze longingly across the Atlantic and wonder: why don't we have universal health care?  Free college tuition?  State-subsidized child care?  The perception is that Europeans, via robust welfare states, enjoy social benefits that remain out of reach for Americans (or at least those Americans who cannot procure them from the market).  This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.  In addition to exploring key cases and areas of policy coverage, we will also consider how policy feedback loops, neoliberalism, globalization, and demographic change (in particular, aging and immigration) all affect the scope and stability of the welfare state on both sides of the Atlantic.","Dobbs, Erica Rose",PO Campus,09:35-10:50AM.

philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are

This course is a survey of the broad literature on social movements and activist organizing
in Latin America. The region, itself a construction built on shared histories of colonialism and nationalism, has
undergone vast changes in the last few decades, through which we can see emerging new social movements,
engagements with global capitalism, and changing political relations between people, the environment, and
the state. This course is designed to introduce students to anthropological theorizing about social movements
and forms of protest, with a particular focus on Latin American collective struggles around race and
indigeneity, citizenship and inequality, gender and sexuality, and environmental justice. The second half of the
course examines five unique ethnographic approaches to the study of contemporary issues in activism and
social movement across Latin America, from the use of different forms of media, to examples of youth
resistance, the building of new democracies, and efforts to decolonize research methodologies.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR

Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being ""woke"" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion.

The class emphasizes using sources to craft well-organized, original scholarly arguments. Students will practice writing in several different expository and argumentative genres, including autobiography, reflection, explanation of concepts, and defending a position on a controversial issue. Before each assignment, we will spend time discussing the writing process, from brainstorming to making final revisions and acknowledging sources. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from peers by critiquing their written work. There will also be a midterm exam. 
A series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way.

philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine

However, if used naively or maliciously, AI can amplify social injustice through algorithmic bias, it can be weaponized by people with harmful political purposes, and it can contribute to a technological culture that undermines human values and self-determination. And when AI is in the drivers seatboth figuratively and literally in the case of autonomous vehicleswho shoulders the responsibility when things go wrong? Beyond these benefits and harms, humans increasingly must grapple with whether to view AI systems as moral agents and patients that deserve rights, moral consideration, or compassion. In this course, students will learn about multiple ethical frameworks before applying them to a variety of case studies and important questions relating to AI. Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will emerge from this course with a deeper appreciation of the landscape of possibilities presented by integrating AI systems into the beautiful messiness of the human world.","Thompson, Kyle",HM Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

This course will use philosophical texts to unpack and explore themes, developed in literature, relating to feminism and philosophy of race, particularly as it pertains to social/political organizing, the metaphysics of gender and race, and the ethics of passing

This course explores the connections between philosophy and literature. Topics vary by semester. Sometimes the course will explore the philosophical issues that arise within literature. The course might also explore the contention that literature provides a special kind of philosophical insight that conventional philosophical writing cannot. Some sections of the course might reflect philosophically on the aesthetics of literature, asking, among other things, what, if anything, makes one work of literature superior to another. Additional topics might be included as well. Prerequisite: one prior course in Philosophy.","Toole, Briana",CM Campus,01:15-02:30PM.  KRV Room 161 (The Kravis Center),MW

All CMC philosophy majors must take at least one advanced seminar, and may take multiple advanced seminars on different topics. Prerequisite: Two previous courses in philosophy. 

The topic for Fall 2023 is ""Torts and Social Justice"" 

Because judges both make and apply tort law, the theories of justice that guide them are directly relevant to the rulings that they make; there is virtually no gap between theory and practical application in tort law â no gap between a theory of justice and its manifestation in the coercive power of the state. We will explore these and other philosophically interesting features of torts by studying a range of theories of tort law, the theories of justice that underlie many of these theories, and their widely differing accounts of who should be held legally accountable for what, and why.  Our particular focus in the 2nd half of the course will be upon the potential of tort law to function as a catalyst for social justice.  Is torts a sphere of law that is particularly ill-suited to the pursuit of social justice, as many argue, or does it provide distinctive opportunities to pursue social justice in impactful ways? No previous work in law or legal theory is required.","Hurley, Paul E.",CM Campus,06:00-09:00PM.  KRV Room 321 (The Kravis Center),M

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR

POST040  PZ-01,International Politics    ,This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the history and theory of international politics. The course is divided into three roughly equal-sized sections.

ANTH109  SC-01,Anthropology of Development    ,"The term development is often used by international funding agencies like the World Bank, governing bodies, and non-governmental organizations, as well as religious organizations, to indicate progress, both economic as well as cultural. Aspirational narratives of economic development as a civilizational end-goal are deployed as justification for instituting billion-dollar infrastructure projects and poverty alleviation programs. Often these narratives of progress overshadow the lived experiences of people on the ground. This course introduces students to the historical and political underpinnings that have led us to understand development as economic growth. Using anthropological critiques of the idea of development, this course helps students to challenge the meanings ascribed to development by foregrounding the experiences of communities (often marginalized by virtue of their status as low-income or indigenous, or because of their gender, race and ethnicity) whose lives are impacted by development projects. This course sheds light on the need to view development with a critical lens and the pressing need to think of alternatives to dominant models of development as economic growth.

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion.

Topics range from the impact of modern science and transformations on global environments, ecological thought and perceptions, climate change, biological exchanges, and the ruins and landscapes left in their aftermaths. Readings include works by Timothy Moreton, Anna Tsing, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Amitav Ghosh, Anne Stoler, Timothy Mitchell, and a film noir series.

PHIL052  PZ-01,Philosophy of Religion    ,"The philosophy of religion is concerned with
philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief.
The nature of religious belief is quite varied across cultures. In Western theism
belief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So
philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine
similar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well
as African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.","Alwishah, Ahmed",PZ Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),W

ASAM179K AA-01,Asian American Women on Screen    ,"This course will examine historical representations of Asian/American women in movies, TV, and new media in American culture. We will start by theorizing hypersexuality and Asian women on screen by thinking about the role militarism plays in constructing gendered and
racialized stereotypes. We will continue thinking about ongoing representational practices of Asian/American women by watching films, TV shows, comedy specials, news clips, and social media. We will consider how engaging and analyzing representation as a site of contestation and
possibilty might create opportunities for rethinking the political power of Asian American media. ","Yim, Rachel",SC Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  HM Room 204 (Humanities Building),M

This course offers a solid introduction to Caribbean-origin Latina literature. Our engagement with literary renderings of the Latina experience will be informed by a recurrent emphasis on representations of history and issues of gender, terms that can be understood culturally, historically, economically, racially, and geographically. Writers seeking to reflect and inform the US immigrant experience have seized on the expressive and critical power of memoir, Bildungsromane, historical fiction, and revolution narratives. Reading the literature of Latinas of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin will show us how immigration and cicular migration inform issues of gender, sexuality, maternity, and reproduction.

How does punishment factor into the public safety of a community? The course will be organized into three principal units: punishment and the divine; punishment and politics; punishment in extra-political contexts. It will examine how social order and power were constructed and maintained in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, and it will draw connections to similar issues of paramount political importance today","Kish, Nathan",SC Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

How did the current international system come about and why does it look the way it does? What are the central institutions and structures that shape global politics and how do they operate? And how should we make sense of the numerous ?global? issues facing states and societies? To answer these questions, this course will highlight a diverse range of approaches to understanding global politics-- including mainstream, interpretivist, post-/ de-colonial, non-Western, and indigenous perspectives-- as well as core concepts, such as the state, sovereignty, and power. We will put these concepts and perspectives to use in order to make sense of a number of contemporary issues in global politics, including identity and difference, international order, climate change, migration, violence and security, and human rights, paying special attention to the role of imperialism and colonialism in making global politics what it is today.

POLI145  SC-01,"Race, Violence, and the Law    ","This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail?

It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, MaÃ¯wenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau. This course introduces students to the art of cinema, its language and techniques, as well as to film analysis. Taught in French with weekly screenings. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent required.

ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

ENGL170K PO-01,The Canterbury Tales    ,"Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine

Philosophy and Modern Art (Rajczi - section 01) - Many people don't like modern art; to them, it seems weird, worthless, or childish. But maybe there's more to modern art than meets the eye. This class looks at examples of modern art to see whether they can tell us anything about key issues in the philosophy of art, including the nature of art, the value of art, how art expresses ideas or emotions, the nature of beauty, and the relationship between art and morality.

Agency and Identity (Basu - section 02)  - In this class we'll explore questions of what it means to be an agent and the ways in which our identities are maintained and created not only through our own actions, but also through our interactions with others. After all, we do not emerge into the world fully formed. Many people in our lives influence the kind of agents we become. For example, who might you have been if your surname placed you elsewhere on the school roster, if you went to a different school, if you were born in a different country, if youâd chosen a different path to walk home that day...etc. Who we become is shaped by many people, institutions, and a lot of it is completely outside of our control.

If used wisely, AI can benefit many domains of human social life, including science, business, medicine, art, transportation, government, and more. However, if used naively or maliciously, AI can amplify social injustice through algorithmic bias, it can be weaponized by people with harmful political purposes, and it can contribute to a technological culture that undermines human values and self-determination. And when AI is in the drivers seatboth figuratively and literally in the case of autonomous vehicleswho shoulders the responsibility when things go wrong? Beyond these benefits and harms, humans increasingly must grapple with whether to view AI systems as moral agents and patients that deserve rights, moral consideration, or compassion. In this course, students will learn about multiple ethical frameworks before applying them to a variety of case studies and important questions relating to AI.

All CMC philosophy majors must take at least one advanced seminar, and may take multiple advanced seminars on different topics. Prerequisite: Two previous courses in philosophy. 

The topic for Fall 2023 is ""Torts and Social Justice"" 

Because judges both make and apply tort law, the theories of justice that guide them are directly relevant to the rulings that they make; there is virtually no gap between theory and practical application in tort law â no gap between a theory of justice and its manifestation in the coercive power of the state. We will explore these and other philosophically interesting features of torts by studying a range of theories of tort law, the theories of justice that underlie many of these theories, and their widely differing accounts of who should be held legally accountable for what, and why.  Our particular focus in the 2nd half of the course will be upon the potential of tort law to function as a catalyst for social justice.  Is torts a sphere of law that is particularly ill-suited to the pursuit of social justice, as many argue, or does it provide distinctive opportunities to pursue social justice in impactful ways? No previous work in law or legal theory is required.","Hurley, Paul E.",CM Campus,06:00-09:00PM.  KRV Room 321 (The Kravis Center),M
POLI161  PO-01,Comparative Social Policy    ,"There is a tendency in some corners of American politics to gaze longingly across the Atlantic and wonder: why don't we have universal health care?  Free college tuition?  State-subsidized child care?  The perception is that Europeans, via robust welfare states, enjoy social benefits that remain out of reach for Americans (or at least those Americans who cannot procure them from the market).  This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.  In addition to exploring key cases and areas of policy coverage, we will also consider how policy feedback loops, neoliberalism, globalization, and demographic change (in particular, aging and immigration) all affect the scope and stability of the welfare state on both sides of the Atlantic.","Dobbs, Erica Rose",PO Campus,09:35-10:50AM.

This course will examine how these two contrasting and sometimes competing understandings, the religiously particular and the secularly universal, have helped to shape Israeli history and society. The first unit of the course will survey the historical and religious connections between the people of Israel and the land of Israel, Jewish political theory, and how modern Zionist thinkers appropriated, modified, and rejected these understandings in developing their rationales for the creation of a Jewish state. The second unit will examine how religion influenced some of the founding policies and institutions of the state, including the Status Quo agreement, Law of Return, and the rabbinate. The final unit will examine the connection between religion and politics in contemporary Israel, and explore the complex and sometimes contested ways in which this connection manifests itself in family law, military service, the administration of holy places, the governing of territories and conflict with Palestinians.","Gilbert, Gary",CM Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

This course offers a solid introduction to Caribbean-origin Latina literature. Our engagement with literary renderings of the Latina experience will be informed by a recurrent emphasis on representations of history and issues of gender, terms that can be understood culturally, historically, economically, racially, and geographically. Writers seeking to reflect and inform the US immigrant experience have seized on the expressive and critical power of memoir, Bildungsromane, historical fiction, and revolution narratives. Reading the literature of Latinas of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin will show us how immigration and cicular migration inform issues of gender, sexuality, maternity, and reproduction.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.","Douglass-Jaimes, Guillermo",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

We will then examine how these structures and institutions continue to reproduce racialized hierarchies and inequalities, and how these forms of inequality and domination have been resisted and contested. To do this we will draw on postcolonial, decolonial, and anti-racist approaches coming from work in political science and international relations, social and political theory, history, and literature.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

Often these narratives of progress overshadow the lived experiences of people on the ground. This course introduces students to the historical and political underpinnings that have led us to understand development as economic growth. Using anthropological critiques of the idea of development, this course helps students to challenge the meanings ascribed to development by foregrounding the experiences of communities (often marginalized by virtue of their status as low-income or indigenous, or because of their gender, race and ethnicity) whose lives are impacted by development projects. This course sheds light on the need to view development with a critical lens and the pressing need to think of alternatives to dominant models of development as economic growth.

But to what extent do these impressions depend on how authors chose to tailor past events to a contemporary political and social background? To what extent did the 'great histories' interact with competing versions of the past? This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours and Bede. Continuities and differences in the historical portrayal of such themes as politics, violence, gender and religion will receive particular attention.

Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship. Students develop an original historical research paper using the theoretical and methodological approaches introduced in class. Previous coursework in History strongly advised.

How did the current international system come about and why does it look the way it does? What are the central institutions and structures that shape global politics and how do they operate? And how should we make sense of the numerous ?global? issues facing states and societies? To answer these questions, this course will highlight a diverse range of approaches to understanding global politics-- including mainstream, interpretivist, post-/ de-colonial, non-Western, and indigenous perspectives-- as well as core concepts, such as the state, sovereignty, and power. We will put these concepts and perspectives to use in order to make sense of a number of contemporary issues in global politics, including identity and difference, international order, climate change, migration, violence and security, and human rights, paying special attention to the role of imperialism and colonialism in making global politics what it is today.

Why do they still matter in global politics today in a supposedly ?postcolonial? world? In this course, we will explore the many ways in which the history and experiences of colonialism and racism have structured and continue to shape global politics. As such, we will consider how many of the structures and institutions of global politics?such as international organizations, international law, and global capitalism?were built to reinforce forms of colonial domination and White supremacy. We will then examine how these structures and institutions continue to reproduce racialized hierarchies and inequalities, and how these forms of inequality and domination have been resisted and contested. To do this we will draw on postcolonial, decolonial, and anti-racist approaches coming from work in political science and international relations, social and political theory, history, and literature. We will also examine a number of historical and contemporary cases including the Haitian Revolution, efforts to build an anti-colonial world order in the mid-twentieth century, ongoing settler colonialism in Turtle Island/North America, and development programs in the Global South. **PENDING FACULTY APPROVAL**","Brown, Owen",SC Campus,02:45-05:30PM.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR

EA  099  PO-01,Urban Health Equity    ,"Where you live impacts how well and how long you live. Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.","Douglass-Jaimes, Guillermo",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

The great division of intellectual labor that these human sciences represent can
seem so natural and so logical, that it is sometimes hard to imagine a world without
them. But these disciplines did not always exist. In exploring their histories, we
simultaneously ask about the contingency of our world and about how it might be

PHIL052  PZ-01,Philosophy of Religion    ,"The philosophy of religion is concerned with
philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief.
The nature of religious belief is quite varied across cultures. In Western theism
belief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So
philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine
similar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well
as African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.","Alwishah, Ahmed",PZ Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),W

A series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way.

WRIT169AOSC-01,Classroom-based Tutoring    ,"In this course, we discuss the theory and practice of a range of pedagogical practices that have been called writing fellows/mentors,embedded tutoring,classroom-based tutoring,curriculum-based tutoring,and subject-area specialist tutoring. In contrast to generalist tutoring that takes place in a writing center or otherwise outside of a classroom, with a tutor who works from a position of unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the essays they tutor, this kind of tutoring presumes specialization and familiarity. It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that ""bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison."" The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as ""Permission of Instructor Required"" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.  State ID and/or passport required.

Students will be leaving campus at 4:30pm and returning at 9:30pm, although there is a Zoom option. Students do not need any prior experience tutoring to be in this course. ","Drake, Kimberly",SC Campus,06:00-09:00PM.  ARR  (Arranged Location),T
