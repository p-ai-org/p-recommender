Africana Studies,AFRI010A AF-01,Intro to Africana Studies    ,"This class will serve as a general introduction to Africana Studies. Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.

Our objective is twofold: first, to explore the autobiographical practices of Black women and the arcs of their lives, approaching autobiographies as both creative works of art and historical documents. Secondly, we will analyze Black women's autobiographies as models of the diverse ways available for writing one's autobiography. The course will equip students to conduct close readings, engage in verbal and written analysis of creative texts, and prepare students to examine the lives of others as stimuli for examining and representing their own.","Finley, J",PO Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

Taught as a reading/discussion seminar, the class introduces students to major movements and debates that contour what is referred to as Black Internationalism. How have Black activists contended with U.S. foreign policy and forged solidarity with liberation movements around the world? How have U.S. understandings of race been shaped by global constructions of race, class, and caste? Exploring these questions, we will engage a dynamic tradition of Black American intellectuals navigating identities as U.S. subject-citizens. Our goals include 1) developing facility with engaging public and scholarly conversations about the role and function of race in contemporary U.S. society 2) nuancing our understanding of the material, social, and political conditions that have linked identity with inequality 3) gaining perspective on race and ethnicity from and beyond the United States.

This intrigue has been reshapedbut not lostwith the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques. In this course, we will examine a range of manifestations of the solar eye, paying particular attention to the relationship(s) it bears to reality and the ways in which the solar eye operates in schemes both great and small of confidence and illusion.

Wokeness is a term created by African Americans and often used as a hashtag in piecemeal ways by
mainstream society. In this course, we will challenge the idea of what wokeness means, its early derivatives, and its true definition by examining mostly early 20th century to more contemporary African American contributors to sociology such as St. Clair Drake,
Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being ""woke"" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding.

What was holiness in the pre-modern Mediterranean and Europe? What made someone a saint rather than a heretic or a witch? How did bodies, genders, sexuality, and asexuality shape these roles over time? This course examines changing relationships between sanctity and the body in the Mediterranean and Europe from the waning days of the Roman Empire to 1550 C.E. Through accounts of people either praised as holy or condemned as heretics, we will explore the possibilities of gender roles and gender fluidity, attitudes toward body and love, and the parameters of the medieval third gender.

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR,None

undergone vast changes in the last few decades, through which we can see emerging new social movements,
engagements with global capitalism, and changing political relations between people, the environment, and

and forms of protest, with a particular focus on Latin American collective struggles around race and
indigeneity, citizenship and inequality, gender and sexuality, and environmental justice. The second half of the

social movement across Latin America, from the use of different forms of media, to examples of youth

Aspirational narratives of economic development as a civilizational end-goal are deployed as justification for instituting billion-dollar infrastructure projects and poverty alleviation programs. Often these narratives of progress overshadow the lived experiences of people on the ground. This course introduces students to the historical and political underpinnings that have led us to understand development as economic growth. Using anthropological critiques of the idea of development, this course helps students to challenge the meanings ascribed to development by foregrounding the experiences of communities (often marginalized by virtue of their status as low-income or indigenous, or because of their gender, race and ethnicity) whose lives are impacted by development projects. This course sheds light on the need to view development with a critical lens and the pressing need to think of alternatives to dominant models of development as economic growth.

Art,ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship.

This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities.

Computer Science,CSCI049D HM-01,CS Studio  / Special Topics in Computer Sci  ,"CS Studio is a studio-type seminar whose raw material is an external project with a significant computational component. Each student joins or brings such a project and, through CS Studio, materially advances its goals by understanding, analyzing, exploring, designing, and implementing new computational capabilities. Equally important are assessment, testing, and iterating across this computing workflow. 

CS Studio's purpose is that each student build skillsets, toolsets, and experience-sets they will bring to future computing challenges. Even as specific technologies vary widely, every CS Studio student will practice (1) exploratory drafting, i.e., exemplifying system behavior outside its context, (2) conceptual shoring, i.e., intentionally pushing beyond a system-as-envisioned to expand on goals, possibilities, and limits, and (3) teamwork-computing: software is communal, and even solo projects benefit from - and depend on - their communities' computational models.

CS Studio can be taken twice, for up to three HMC units of credit. It is not a cs-major elective.

Close reading begins, not with the question, ""What do these words mean?"" but instead, the question, ""What do these words say?""  And then, ""What if these words mean just what they say?""  And then, ""What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).

English or Engl Wrld Lit,ENGL158  JT-01,Ovidian Figures    ,"Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's ""intention"" ""to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms."" This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

impacted by food system workers. Today, the increased availability of cheaper food, larger portion sizes, the reliance on high calorie,
processed ingredients, the types of food available in many communities, government policies, and lifestyle choices have led to an
epidemic of food-related health problems. At the same time, many Americans struggle with food insecurity due to wage stagnation
and economic disruptions. Food systems are both major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly vulnerable to
climate change. The sustainability of human civilization hinges on the resilience of our food systems. In this course, we develop an indepth understanding of food systems - the people, processes, and resources that move our food from farm and ocean to plate.

If used wisely, AI can benefit many domains of human social life, including science, business, medicine, art, transportation, government, and more. However, if used naively or maliciously, AI can amplify social injustice through algorithmic bias, it can be weaponized by people with harmful political purposes, and it can contribute to a technological culture that undermines human values and self-determination. And when AI is in the drivers seatboth figuratively and literally in the case of autonomous vehicleswho shoulders the responsibility when things go wrong? Beyond these benefits and harms, humans increasingly must grapple with whether to view AI systems as moral agents and patients that deserve rights, moral consideration, or compassion. In this course, students will learn about multiple ethical frameworks before applying them to a variety of case studies and important questions relating to AI. Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will emerge from this course with a deeper appreciation of the landscape of possibilities presented by integrating AI systems into the beautiful messiness of the human world.","Thompson, Kyle",HM Campus,02:45-04:00PM.

Ultimately, the goal of the class is to situate love within and beyond socio-economic structures, like capitalism and heterocetera-patriarchy, in order to understand why love is the corrective to power and the answer to the problem of human existence.","Gampa, Anup",HM Campus,01:15-04:00PM.

If used wisely, AI can benefit many domains of human social life, including science, business, medicine, art, transportation, government, and more. However, if used naively or maliciously, AI can amplify social injustice through algorithmic bias, it can be weaponized by people with harmful political purposes, and it can contribute to a technological culture that undermines human values and self-determination. And when AI is in the drivers seatboth figuratively and literally in the case of autonomous vehicleswho shoulders the responsibility when things go wrong? Beyond these benefits and harms, humans increasingly must grapple with whether to view AI systems as moral agents and patients that deserve rights, moral consideration, or compassion. In this course, students will learn about multiple ethical frameworks before applying them to a variety of case studies and important questions relating to AI.

Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR,None

The perception is that Europeans, via robust welfare states, enjoy social benefits that remain out of reach for Americans (or at least those Americans who cannot procure them from the market).  This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.  In addition to exploring key cases and areas of policy coverage, we will also consider how policy feedback loops, neoliberalism, globalization, and demographic change (in particular, aging and immigration) all affect the scope and stability of the welfare state on both sides of the Atlantic.","Dobbs, Erica Rose",PO Campus,09:35-10:50AM.

Late Antique-Medvl Stds,ENGL170K PO-01,The Canterbury Tales    ,"Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours and Bede. Continuities and differences in the historical portrayal of such themes as politics, violence, gender and religion will receive particular attention.

How far reaching is ""the great separation"" between church and state? Does it require the development of a secular citizenry? Is it consistent with claims that America is a Christian nation? The vexed relationship between church and state is at the heart of public debates regarding education, marriage, and numerous other issues. To illuminate current debates we will examine the philosophical and political arguments for separation and how these have played out over the course of American constitutional history.

Legal Studies,POLI145  SC-01,"Race, Violence, and the Law    ","This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

What does it mean to live the good life; to never experience lack or scarcity and to be surrounded by plenty? Can human societies realize such edenic conditions without the toil, labor, and suffering of others? How can a no-place be an ideal place? Is the ideal place for some people an injurious place for others? In addition to examining these questions, we will consider how political and critical theory bleed into utopian/dystopian texts, while also reflecting on how these texts interrogate and challenge those theories.

Mideast & No Africa Stds,HIST131C CM-01,Crusading Mentalities    ,"This seminar explores the causes, meanings, meaningfulness and commemoration of new religious identities shaped by war: from the reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula, to the new heretics in Central Europe and clashes between Latin and Orthodox Christians in Constantinople; and from contentious labels of heretic, Jew, infidel and pagan, to new institutional mechanisms for defining cultural difference around the Mediterranean. The course objective is to understand how a series of events in medieval history that shaped medieval culture led to the invention of a violent paradigm of Islamic-Christian relations intended to mask internal social and religious divisions, and continues to shape the rhetoric of cultural encounter that divides our world today.","Ferguson, Heather",CM Campus,11:00AM-12:15PM.

How do social movements change the world by changing ideas, identities, and norms about the public good? How do they introduce new actors and forms of activism into the political sphere? How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail? This class explores these questions in comparative context, through cases spanning the Christian Right and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in the United States, Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Syria, religious and gendered activism in Saudi Arabia, Palestinian militants, and transnational human rights networks.","Pahwa, Sumita",SC Campus,09:35-10:50AM.

In this course we examine how people collectively organize in the 21st Century, the types of creative
social movement organizational structures that emerged from the first World Social Forum, and how
they influenced local movements like #BlackLivesMatter. Some movements captivate local imaginations
and others go global. What creative ways have movement organizers re-configured old ideas for the new
age and what new ones have emerged? The course is designed around three themes: What is to be done; How is it to be done; and The possibilities of what can be done.",Staff,PZ Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),M,None

In contrast to generalist tutoring that takes place in a writing center or otherwise outside of a classroom, with a tutor who works from a position of unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the essays they tutor, this kind of tutoring presumes specialization and familiarity. It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that ""bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison."" The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as ""Permission of Instructor Required"" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.  State ID and/or passport required.

Students will be leaving campus at 4:30pm and returning at 9:30pm, although there is a Zoom option. Students do not need any prior experience tutoring to be in this course. ","Drake, Kimberly",SC Campus,06:00-09:00PM.  ARR  (Arranged Location),T,None

Close reading begins, not with the question, ""What do these words mean?"" but instead, the question, ""What do these words say?""  And then, ""What if these words mean just what they say?""  And then, ""What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).

This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one ""body"" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of ""affordance"" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the ""vivid"" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.

But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

climate catastrophe at personal and communal levels?as thinking, feeling, and justice-
oriented beings. This course requires readings, active discussion, and process-oriented
brainstorming and praxis work. We embody the principle of thinking through (and thinking
with) environmental problems by reading about the work of scholars and activists who
question anthropocentrism, and we create our own projections of what is to come. Our goal for
the class is to generate collective approaches for surviving and thriving even when the planet

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.

U.S. Politics: Resistance and Transformation

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. ",Staff,PZ Campus,09:35-10:50AM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),TR,None

This course examines changing relationships between sanctity and the body in the Mediterranean and Europe from the waning days of the Roman Empire to 1550 C.E. Through accounts of people either praised as holy or condemned as heretics, we will explore the possibilities of gender roles and gender fluidity, attitudes toward body and love, and the parameters of the medieval third gender.

This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours and Bede.

philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief.
The nature of religious belief is quite varied across cultures. In Western theism
belief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So
philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine
similar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well
as African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.","Alwishah, Ahmed",PZ Campus,02:45-05:30PM.  TBA  (To Be Assigned),W,None
