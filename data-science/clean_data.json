interdisciplinary introduction to principal themes in American culture taught by an intercollegiate faculty team.","1":"Covers numerous developments in American print culture through the careful examination of both textbooks and artifacts (period books, magazines, newspapers, letters, diaries, advertisements, etc.).","2":"A focus on the experience of immigrants in the United States and Americans of diverse ethnic backgrounds, as reflected in literature and critical theory. The course will weave together works that treat the lives of immigrants and minority groups in the United States with examinations of such contemporary issues as bilingual education, the conditions of migrant workers, and children as cultural and linguistic interpreters for their parents. The intentionally broad and interdisciplinary nature of the course enables exploration of cultural identities, socio-economic status, and gender-specific roles.","3":"An exploration of cultural attitudes toward life and the human body: from Melanesian origin myths to the human genome project; from the first autopsies to cloning and genetic manipulation; from early body snatchings to the trade in bodies and body parts in the global economy. The question of what constitutes life is subject to controversy, and how it is answered is informed by cultural differences in practices, knowledge, and beliefs. This course aims to help students develop a sophisticated and informed attitude towards cultural difference.","4":"An introduction to science and technology as cultural phenomena and a hands-on initiation into anthropology. While applying basic anthropological methods in the academic environment, students gain an understanding of science and technology as a culturally, socially, and historically specific way of constructing knowledge. In other words, rather than taking for granted the ways in which we make knowledge, this course renders those ways of knowledge-making \u201cstrange.\u201d","5":"\u201cThe wings of the butterfly\u2014that cause the hurricane at the other end of the earth\u2014aren\u2019t guilty, right? \u2026 no one is.\u201d \u201cJust the opposite,\u201d replies Faulques. \u201cWe are all a part of the monster that moves us around the chessboard.\u201d As Faulques\u2014the painter\/ war-photographer protagonist in Perez-Reverte\u2019s novel The Painter of Battles\u2014sees it, war and destruction and their attendant personal horrors are more ordinary, more typical of human beings than peace and civil order. But while chaos has its own rules and symmetries and nothing is coincidental or happens by chance, as spectators we are complicit in the occurrences of violent upheaval about which we read each day in The New York Times. We will investigate this premise. How do we explain war; what is it for? What does war do to us\u2014distant or not-so-distant spectators\u2014and to others\u2014willing or unwilling participants? Is war endemic to the human condition? Is it a necessary evil? Does it emerge from psychologi\u00adcal and irrational \u201cdrives,\u201d or from economic, rational considerations? If we have a talent for war, do we have a talent for peace?","6":"What does it mean to be rational? Does it mean anything, to say that you are thinking rationally? This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, \u201cscientific rationality\u201d\u2014as we will call it for the moment\u2014is \u201clocated.\u201d What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compel\u00adling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps \u201cat work\u201d even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer these questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic\u2014the elements of \u201cscientific rationality.\u201d Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for \u201cus\u201d what is \u201cirrational.\u201d Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that \u201cdo\u201d science act, think and make knowledge.","7":"This course explores how photographic landscape imagery has shaped our experience and ideas of the land. Examining work dating back to the invention of the medium in 1839 to contemporary artists to NASA\u2019s Mars Rover images, we will consider how photographic imagery documents and determines the topography around us.","8":"This class is an experimental lecture style art making\/art history hybrid course. Lectures will focus on art practices of the last 120 years. Students will create unconventional art projects (not papers) in response to the course material and partake in massive public pop-up exhibitions and interventions throughout the Harvey Mudd College campus.","9":"Approaching the medium from an artistic perspective, students will explore a variety of photographic concepts and techniques. This course emphasizes seeing, thinking, and creat\u00ading with a critical mind and eye to provide understanding of the construction and manipula\u00adtion of photographic form and meaning. The fundamentals of working with a digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR), including manual controls and lighting, are covered. Students will also explore everything from cell phone cameras, web cams, and disposable cameras as equally legitimate tools for creating art. Assignments, lectures, readings, and excursions will build on each other to provide students with an overview of the history and contemporary practice of photography. $150 course fee.","10":"This workshop introduces students to the basic vocabulary and practices of typeset\u00adting, typography, and printing for and on an iron hand press. Work includes a skill-building project and a student-designed semester project.","11":"Embracing the contemporary idea that art is not grounded in technique or medium but driven by concepts, this course emphasizes thinking and creating within a context of historical and theoretical concerns. Students will be challenged to re-contextualize skills they already have to address questions central to twentieth and twenty-first century art making. They will be expected to work beyond traditional labels such as painting, sculpture, photog\u00adraphy, etc. and use unexpected processes, picking those which are best suited to their ideas and push the envelope as to what is considered art.","12":"Viewing of films and other documentary forms by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for critique and discussion. Basic instruction in use of digital video technology to document social issues relevant to Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Community-project.","13":"This course will explore various topics within Indigenous education. Through a variety of mixed methods, this seminar will examine previous and current educational policy and its effects on diverse Indigenous peoples. It will also examine education as a tool for empowerment, resistance, and healing within varied Indigenous communities. Course topics covered include: Native\/Indigenous epistemology, decolonizing methodologies, settler colonialism, cultural reclamation, and critical pedagogy. In addition to the course materials, students will engage in service learning by partnering with the Saturday Tongan Education Program (STEP). Participating in STEP will allow students to actively participate in an Indigenous educational initiative that directly relates to the course content and discussions.","14":"This survey course examines the history of Asian immigrant groups and their American-born descendants as they have settled and adjusted to life in the United States since 1850.

Westerners have long regarded technological innovation as a facilitator of global democratic advancement. The last two decades have shattered this assumption, demonstrating technology\u2019s capacity to exacerbate political polarization, to facilitate anti-competitive monopolies, and to ignite forces of illiberal populism.

Concern with the relation between psychological investigation and political activity has a long history, and goes back to the portrayal of Achilles in The Iliad and Suetonius\u2019 investigation of perverse leadership in The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. In its modern form it originates in Freud\u2019s 1921 essay, \u201cMass Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego.\u201d In the realm of political science, Harold Lasswell (Psychopathology and Politics) studied politics through psychoanalytic ideas, and he has been followed by many other political analysts.","694":"International law is the law of nations, but it can also be the law applied to individuals, relationships, and transactions that cross national boundaries.

Specific topics include the extent and nature of the problem; the response of police, prosecutors and courts; the nature and extent of punishment imposed for criminal behavior; the philosophic basis for punishment; the role that public opinion does and ought to play in guiding criminal justice policy; and the performance of representative institutions in meeting the crime problem.","698":"Over two hundred years into the American experiment, issues of church and state continue to divide the nation. How far reaching is \u201cthe great separation\u201d between church and state? Does it require the development of a secular citizenry? Is it consistent with claims that America is a Christian nation? The vexed relationship between church and state is at the heart of public debates regarding education, marriage, and numerous other issues. To illuminate current debates we will examine the philosophical and political arguments for separation and how these have played out over the course of American constitutional history.","699":"Intensive analyses of major judicial opinions on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments, focusing on search and seizure, self-incrimination, right to counsel, and other procedural rights of accused persons.","700":"This course will examine key issues in the debate over the death penalty throughout Western history, with an emphasis on the current debate within the United States. Focusing on the crime of murder, readings will begin with the ancient legal codes of Hammurabi and Moses and extend up to the most recent court decisions and social science research in the United States. The course will cover the most important philosophic and religious arguments for and against the death penalty, as well as all the major critiques currently leveled against the practice of capital punishment in the United States. Readings will also cover the treatment of the death penalty in popular culture, including ancient Greek plays, the plays of Shakespeare, the debate among the Romantic poets of the 19th century, Clarence Darrow\u2019s classic attack on the death penalty in the 1920s, and modern Hollywood treatments.","701":"The purpose of this course is to explore whether and how gender matters in American law, and to examine the constitutional and statutory legal doctrines that apply in sex discrimination claims. More specifically, the course will (a) examine the ways gender has affected citizenship status; (b) address major constitutional themes that are invoked in sex discrimination cases and their evolution across time; and (c) consider how alternative schools of legal thought address these issues. Particular attention will be paid to employment law, reproductive rights, family law, and criminal law.","702":"An interdisciplinary seminar focusing on selected contemporary problems in the law. Examples include: (a) constitutional interpretation, (b) development of the rule of law, and (c) presidential war powers. The topics will vary from year to year.","703":"This course will examine the development of American public policy starting with the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. While offering a broad overview of economic and social policy in this era, the course will focus particular attention on the New Deal of the 1930\u2019s, the Great Society of the 1960\u2019s, and the Reagan Revolution of the 1980\u2019s. The course material will also illuminate how policy is the product of the interaction of people, ideas, politics, and events.","704":"The course examines the character of the political opinions calling themselves liberalism and conservatism, from their emergence in the 18th century to their flourishing and possible decline in the 20th century and beyond. Though the course will focus on their American forms, it will contrast these with the appropriate British and Continental counterparts. Throughout, attention will be paid to the variety of doctrines within each school of thought, and to what unites as well as divides the politics of liberalism and conservatism as a whole.","705":"This course introduces human rights as a dominant field in international law and international relations. It examines historical origins of the concept, international legal underpinnings, and dynamics that have driven its expansion and limited its success. The course focuses on international actors operating under the United Nations including the Security Council, Human Rights Council, and bodies monitoring treaty obligations. It also covers regional human rights systems, including Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Specific topics include: torture, racism, disappearances, genocide, LGBT rights, hate speech, women\u2019s rights, and economic, social and cultural rights. Broader themes involve the tensions between the universality of human rights and cultural relativism, state sovereignty, terrorism, armed conflicts, and whether human rights law has made a positive contribution to the actual realization of human rights.","706":"This course uses South Asian literature in English translation to recover a picture of social, cultural, and political life in the period 1700 to the present. The literature includes diaries, poetry, novels, and essays. It gives us data on the everyday life of the period, but also on questions such as, What was the experience of modernity? and, How are gendered and class identities experienced? Students will read literature but learn how to think historically.","707":"The history of South Asia (modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka & Nepal) includes equal parts of dramatic narrative and controversies in interpretation. Who were the Aryans? Is Emperor Akbar\u2019s popularity as a synthesizer of Hindu-Muslim interests justified? What does Buddhist sculpture tell us of gender relations? How old really is Indian \u201cclassical\u201d music and dance? Why did Partition take place? This course will expose us to the rich historical narratives of the area, usually from primary sources, and equally to the complex interpretations of political, social and intellectual questions. The semester will be divided between three periods (Ancient, Medieval and Modern) of South Asian History for convenience.","708":"This course is the second of two parts of an introduction to the civilization(s) of historical India, or present-day status of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. These three hundred years consist of complex changes in the economy, social structure, and the values of this life and an after life. The course looks at the agencies of change such as colonial law and education, mass media and technology, and demography. The main focus, however, will be on the experiences of people of this change and the emergence of new identities.","709":"This course explores various categories of Roman culture that defined both private lives and the public image of society. Topics include wealth, patronage, gender, slavery, violence, and death. By examining a variety of primary sources - histories, poetry, letter, and urban fabric - we shall better appreciate the ways in which private life in ancient Rome was a public performance.","710":"This survey is an introduction to the pre-Modern history of the peoples of the classical Islamic lands, from North Africa to Central Asia. The course will cover the time period from the rise of Islam to the Mongol invasions of the 13th century and their aftermath, examining topics such as geography and environment, relations between nomadic and sedentary peoples, the formation of Islamic law, science and philosophy, and the relation between the rulers and the ruled, the state and its subjects.","711":"A survey of the social, political, and economic history of Islamic societies since ca.1500. Beginning with an examination of the Turkic \u201cgunpowder empires,\u201d the course then explores the ways in which capitalist market economies, European penetration, and nation building projects transformed the region during the 19th and 20th centuries. Subjects include state and society under the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals; colonialism and imperialism, capitalism and the integration of the region into the world system; responses to the West; the territorial settlement of the Middle East and the emergence of the Mandate System after the first World War; nationalism; the question of Palestine; and the modern revival of Islamic movements.","712":"The rise and development of Chinese (Sinitic\/Confucian) civilization from Neolithic origins to its full maturation in the 18th century and the struggle of countries on the periphery of the Chinese cultural zone - primarily Japan and secondarily Korea and Vietnam - to retain distinct cultural and political identities while borrowing aspects of Chinese culture. Themes include state building, the changing role of women, cultural and aesthetic traditions, religious values, and political patterns. Special attention is given to divergent paths of pre-modern development which helped condition 20th-century approaches to political\/economic modernization.","713":"Revolution, state building, modernization, and socio-cultural change in three representative cultural zones of Asia. The first part of the course examines imperialism and de-colonization, socio-religious reform movements, changing gender roles, and dynamics of political revolution. The second part explores the new forces which have reshaped the countries: the passing of charismatic leaders and revolutionary development strategies, the Japanese\/East Asian economic model, and problems defining culture.","714":"The timeless monumentality of the ancient Mediterranean often conveys a sense of durability and resistance to change, but ancient societies were also proverbial for disasters, both natural and human. Poised on a fragile balance between plenty and crisis, disasters strained resources at every level, but ancient communities were nevertheless surprisingly resilient. This course explores a wide range of disasters - earthquakes and volcanoes, floods and drought, plague and famine, fires and riots, sieges and sackings, military catastrophes and genocide - to better understand the capacity of ancient communities to respond to adversity. How enduring was the impact of disaster, what resources were mobilized in response, and what were the psychological strategies for coping?","715":"The course will consider how the character of power structures changed over the course of the long seventeenth century in Europe and the Americas. Specific focus will be placed on the role of the visual arts in projecting or subverting political and religious authority. Organized by city center, we will pursue questions related to the consequences of the Protestant Reformation, the rise of the Dutch Republic, and the increasing circulation of ideas and objects through global trade. The status of the art object in the context of Counter Reformation and the proliferation of printed matter will also be considered along with the emergence of new genres of artistic expression such as crowned nun portraits and \u2018casta\u2019 paintings.","716":"This course offers a broadly based inquiry into the late-classical, Germanic, Judeo-Christian and Islamic cultures that constituted Europe and the Mediterranean from the Carolingian Empire which emerged after the fall of the Roman Empire to the height of medieval Christendom in the 14th century. Designed to provide students with an overview of the history of Europe and the Mediterranean from ca. 800-1300, the course will explore such topics as the consolidation of \u201cbarbarian kingdoms\u201d after the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Church as a governing institution; the rise and importance of monasticism; medieval notions of sexuality, ethnicity, and identity; the transformation of the feudal state into commercial economies; Byzantine, Islamic and western Christian scholarship; kingship knighthood and the Crusades.","717":"An examination of the major issues in the rise of modern Europe from the 18th to the 21st centuries. Major topics include the secularization of culture, the industrial revolution, imperialism, the rise of the modern nation state, and rise of new political-economic systems such as capitalism, democracy, fascism, and communism. The course concludes by examining the devastation of two world wars, Europe\u2019s post-war recovery, and Europe\u2019s new relationship with the world.","718":"Museums count among the greatest institutions ever created. Yet they are more than repositories of knowledge and human accomplishment. They are national symbols, projections of power, and the embodiment of a people\u2019s values. As such, they have often been at the center of political controversy. This course examines the history of museums and the challenges faced by their founders and leaders. Topics include the history of museums in the West; the debate over the possession of antiquities; the disposition of Nazi looted objects; the ethical challenges faced by the leaders of museums; and the future of museums.","719":"This course will survey the history of North America from the sixteenth to the late nineteenth centuries. We will follow along as a small and diverse collection of ramshackle European settlements grew into wealthy colonies, how they fought for independence and established a united republic, and how that republic in turn grew into an empire. We will study this history not in isolation, but within the context of the Atlantic world, and the turbulent flows of peoples, goods, and ideas within it.","720":"This introductory survey course, beginning with the United States\u2019 emergence in the late 19th century as an industrialized, urbanized society, traces America\u2019s evolution into a complex, heterogeneous, \u201cmodern\u201d state.","721":"Between 1815 and 1900, the United States experienced a dramatic transformation, from a minor outpost in the Atlantic economy to the world\u2019s leading manufacturer. The mass market and the large, private corporation became the defining features of American capitalism. This lecture-discussion class will examine the origins and development of that system, with particular attention to its social history. We will ask how diverse communities of Americans constructed, challenged, and were shaped by the expansion of the capitalist economy.","722":"This course is an introductory survey of the histories and cultures of Latin America, focusing on struggles for power between elite and popular groups from pre-1492 to the present day. It is divided in four broad sections: The encounter between Europeans and Indigenous peoples and structures of Colonial society; Latin American Independence and the meanings of independence for slaves, women, and others not considered full citizens of emerging nations; Twentieth century nationalisms, revolutions and dictatorships; and, contemporary social movements and politics in Latin America. This is a writing-intensive course geared toward first-years and sophomores.","723":"From the time of the conquest, the outside world turned the Amazon into an imagined place to unleash their adventure fantasies about lost cities of gold and their fears about savage jungles and Indians. From a historical perspective, this course interrogates the creation of Amazonia from the nineteenth-century rubber boom to contemporary environmental campaigns. We analyze visual images, explorers\u2019 accounts, ethnographies, novels, films, advertisements and environmental campaigns. The point is to understand how the Amazon and its people have been imagined externally and internally, and why certain narratives hold power in the Western world.","724":"The course evaluates testimonial literature, a cross between oral history and biography, as a historical source to locate subaltern voices usually excluded from the official documents used to write history. We debate the truths and validity of such sources and use interpretative tools such as theories on subjectivity, memory and discourse analysis for using testimonial literature as a historical source. We also look at how testimonies have been used as evidence in human rights commissions and translated into mass media for national and international audiences.","725":"This course examines the modern history of United States and Latin American relations. It employs a cultural approach to interrogate the processes of forming geopolitical distinctions in the twentieth century. While we examine classic cases of U.S. intervention in Latin America and Latin American cases of Anti-Americanism, the framework of transnational history provides a platform to examine hemispheric solidarities and exchanges through primary and secondary sources. Course themes include theories of development (modernization and dependency theories), human rights and Cold War politics, claims of imperialism and anti-Americanism as well as exchanges of popular culture and identities among the peoples and nations of the Americas.","726":"The Cold War dramatically shaped the politics, culture and society of the United States while giving the country an altered place in the world. This course provides both a way to think about U.S. History within a global context and an introduction to historical analysis, research, and writing. Topics include the Red Scare, Civil Rights, consumer culture, decolonization and CIA interventions, immigration policy, the Reagan Revolution, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the USSR. We will pay close attention the relationships between domestic and foreign affairs and politics and popular culture.","727":"Selected topics in history. By invitation only.","728":"This course explores the history of Rome from its foundations as a small village in the middle of the 8th century BCE to its establishment as an imperial power over the Mediterranean world through the 1st century BCE. Rome\u2019s expansion from a city-state to a world power and the social, political, and economic implications of this expansion will constitute the primary focus of the course. But we will also examine material culture, religion, social customs, sub-elites, and women, and the dynamics of cultural interaction in the ancient Mediterranean. Students will concentrate throughout the course on the primary evidence and the ways in which historians use literary and material sources to uncover different perspectives on the Roman past. First part of a sequence on Roman history.","729":"This course examines the manifold techniques adopted and adapted by Roman emperors and their representatives to govern a vast territory that at its greatest extent stretched from the British Isles to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Particular attention will be given to changes in traditional Roman political, social, and cultural practices brought about by the emergence of a monarchical government, economic crises, ethnic diversity, and the rise of Christianity. Part two of a sequence on Roman history.","730":"Described as Late Antiquity or the Early Middle Ages, the period from Constantine to Charlemagne (roughly 300 to 800 AD) represents an age of vibrant and dynamic cultural transition sometimes viewed as a crucible for the blending of Roman, barbarian and Christian cultural elements. Using the major primary sources and the standard modern accounts for the period, this course will examine the key categories in which cultural change presents itself to the historian-the movement of migrant peoples, the political development of \u201csuccessor\u201d states, the consolidation of diverse religious practices and the rise of the Catholic Church, material and social changes in urban society, reorientation of economy and land use, and the transmission of an intellectual culture through art and literature that was both heir to Classical tradition and aware of its own novelty.","731":"The Roman world sustained a vibrant habit for the exchange of letters. From Egypt to Britain, and from Italy to Syria, correspondents shared snapshots of life stories, political gossip, advice for managing households, and condolences for the loss of loved ones. Many of these letters are deeply personal, disclosing the emotional lives of prominent social actors, and at the same time revealing priceless information about topics such as slavery, gender, religious life, and legal culture. Other letters are official government documents that provide otherwise inaccessible details about the ancient economy and government administration. Moreover, letters were understood to be gifts that enriched the lives and status of recipients. As such, they were crafted with literary artistry and often reveal the depth of ancient engagement with literature, history, and ethics. This seminar allows students to explore a select number of letter collections that are key to understanding the rich complexities of ancient life from the 2nd to 6th centuries CE.","732":"Works surviving from the great historians of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean populate the imagination with impressions of distant worlds. But to what extent do these impressions depend on how authors chose to tailor past events to a contemporary political and social background? To what extent did the \u201cgreat histories\u201d interact with competing versions of the past? This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman, and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours, and Bede. Continuities and differences in the historical portrayal of such themes as politics, violence, gender, and religion will receive particular attention.","733":"The life, works, and death of Cicero is in some ways iconic for the last stages of the Roman Republic. Cicero\u2019s life spanned a period of intense political, social, and intellectual change that would inevitably lead to the rise of autocratic emperors. Sometimes a participant, and always an acute observer of affairs in Rome, Cicero provides us with a remarkably detailed picture of an ancient society in evolution. This course will follow, and question the nature of, the end of the Roman Republic through a close inspection of Cicero\u2019s political speeches and court cases, letters to friends (and enemies), and moral and philosophical treatises.","734":"Selected topics in ancient history.","735":"Selected topics in European history.","736":"Selected topics in American history.","737":"This course introduces students to the major themes, movements, and moments in the environmental history of the United States. Environmental historians see the natural world as both a material place and a historical and cultural idea. This class focuses on the theme of \u201cnature:\u201d how human societies have shaped the natural world, how the natural world has shaped human societies, and how ideas about what is \u201cnatural\u201d have been created, challenged, and changed in American history from the colonial period to the present.","738":"This course examines the development of ideas of race and racial difference in the Atlantic World from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Contact and interaction between indigenous Americans, Europeans, and Africans produced fabricated categories of social standing that continue to the present day. The class will explore how colonial regimes worked aggressively to police those racial lines. Yet, we will also consider how relations between and among those groups challenged and altered these racial constructs. This will culminate in an overall discussion on the evolution of modern racial attitudes.","739":"This course examines the history of slavery in many global locations across multiple periods of time. Beginning with ancient forms of bound labor, it then traces the growth of slavery in the Americas, built initially upon the enslavement of indigenous people, but ultimately most substantially with African workers. The course closely follows the rise of the transatlantic slave trade from Africa, which produced distinct and variable slave regimes in the Americas. In the process, the class will explore the lived experiences and forms of resistance of those who were enslaved, and includes considerations of modern forms of oppression.","740":"This course examines the Brazilian national narrative of \u201cracial democracy,\u201d or the idea that Brazilian society is a \u201cracial paradise,\u201d lacking racial distinctions due to racial mixing. We examine dominant racial ideologies that preceded the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy, how racial democracy turned into a national project of the Vargas Era (1930-45), and challenges proposed by black intellectuals and indigenous groups. After 1945, the course addresses how ideas of racial democracy intersect with gender\/sexuality, modernization policies, people excluded from the national mixed-race type, authoritarian rule, and popular culture. At the end of the course, students debate contemporary racially based policies such as Affirmative Action in Brazil.","741":"The Cold War dramatically shaped the politics, culture, and society of the United States while giving the country an altered place in the world. This course provides both a way to think about U.S. History within a global context and an introduction to historical analysis, research, and writing. Topics include the Red Scare, Civil Rights, consumer culture, decolonization, and CIA interventions, immigration policy, the Reagan Revolution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall the dissolution of the USSR. We will pay close attention to the relationships between domestic and foreign affairs and politics and popular culture.","742":"This course will analyze the history of American women in political life, broadly defined, from the mid-19th century to the present. Following a historical chronology, we will consider the debate over the 15th amendment, the movement for female suffrage. Reforms of the Progressive era, activism through church and community groups, the New Deal, the Civil Rights movement, the women\u2019s movement, and women officeholders today. Throughout we will consider women\u2019s political work as legislators, public policy makers, reformers, and activists. Previously HIST175 CM.","743":"This course examines Native American history from the era before European contact to the present. It focuses on the cultural, social, and economic developments of a number of indigenous societies throughout this period. Native people not only built the foundations upon which colonial societies grew, but they were also instrumental in the progression of history in the Americas. This course will explore how Native Americans reacted and adapted to the arrival of European settlers, as well as to how they helped shape the story of the United States.","744":"This course will examine the political, cultural, economic and social processes of suburbanization and its consequences in the United States over the past century. We will analyze the policies that gave rise to the growth of American suburbia as well as the popular culture and political constructions that shaped the ideal of the American Dream. Topics include the urban crisis and battles over desegregation, race and class inequality, sprawl and land-use planning, family, education, youth culture, consumer capitalism, the subprime mortgage crisis, and new immigrant, racial and ethnic enclaves. We will pay particular attention to Southern California and the Inland Empire. Previously HIST171 CM.","745":"This course provides a topical and thematic approach to the history of the United States since 1945. The intersection between politics, culture, and society serves as the course\u2019s main emphasis. Topics include the Cold War, Vietnam, suburbanization, mass consumer culture, the fate of liberalism and the rise of conservatism, the social movements of the Left and the Right, globalization, and the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d","746":"Americans have long viewed schools as vehicles for democratic participation and social mobility. At the same time, differences of race, class, ethnicity, religion, and gender have shaped educational experiences in profound ways. This course examines the history of schooling in the United States with a focus on battles over educational access and equality. Topics include immigrant education, segregation and desegregation, bilingual education, and debates over school reform today. Throughout, we will consider American schooling as a story of both unfolding opportunity and unfulfilled promises.","747":"This course examines the role of the American West within U.S. history from the Gold Rush era to the present. Students will examine major themes within the field such as migration and settlement, the environment, role of the federal government\/public policy, popular culture, and the peopling of the West. The course will address historian Frederick Jackson Turner\u2019s thesis regarding the uniqueness of the American experience and character on the frontier.","748":"This survey course examines the history of Asian immigrant groups and their American-born descendants as they have settled and adjusted to life in the United States. We will explore issues such as the experience of immigration, daily life in urban ethnic enclaves, and racist campaigns against Asian immigrants. Throughout the course, we will ask how these issues relate to a larger history of American nation-building and diplomatic relations with Asia.","749":"This seminar examines the American Civil War, from its causes to its legacy. Rather than a traditional military history of the war, we will focus on the political, social, and cultural issues that defined its time. Through primary and secondary sources, we will discuss topics such as slavery, sectionalism, social transformations on the battlefield as well as the home front, emancipation, Reconstruction, and Civil War memory.","750":"This course explores the experiences of people in the United States whom we might today define as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer. Drawing on recent scholarship, it analyzes those experiences in the context of American political, economic, social, legal, urban, and military history, with emphasis on the 20th century. Topics include changing categories of identity, the role of state policies and actions, the effects of wartime, Cold War persecution, the rise of gay and lesbian liberation movements, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the emergence of queer theory, debates over military exclusion and same-sex marriage, and the significance of race, religion, class, gender, and region.","751":"A seminar comparing how these two great urban centers experienced the tremendous social upheavals of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the developments of capitalism, revolution, war, urbanization, modernity, and alienation play themselves out in London and Paris between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the end of the First World War? We will examine historical texts, maps, economic and demographic data, art, architecture, novels, poetry, popular culture, detective stories, photography, and early film.","752":"This course questions both modernist and Orientalist assumptions concerning urban life in the Middle East on the cusp of a transformative moment in global history\u2014commercialization and the emergence of new imperial forms. We will explore the complex problem of the emergence of a \u201cmiddle class\u201d which includes changes in the definitions of masculinity and femininity, domestic versus public space, non-Muslim and Muslim participation in civic society, political administration, and the creation and production of culture. Our chronological focus will be on urban centers during the evolution of Ottoman modernity and our historiographic focus will be on the relationship between the built environment and structures of power.","753":"This seminar explores the causes, meanings, meaningfulness and commemoration of new religious identities shaped by war: from the reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula, to the new heretics in Central Europe and clashes between Latin and Orthodox Christians in Constantinople; and from contentious labels of heretic, Jew, infidel and pagan, to new institutional mechanisms for defining cultural difference around the Mediterranean. The course objective is to understand how a series of events in medieval history that shaped medieval culture led to the invention of a violent paradigm of Islamic-Christian relations intended to mask internal social and religious divisions, and continues to shape the rhetoric of cultural encounter that divides our world today.","754":"During the twentieth century, the totality and modern features of the mass murder of civilians proved so alarming and unprecedented that by mid-century observers, led by Raphael Lemkin, developed a new concept for this historical phenomenon: genocide. This course will focus on case studies of genocide and genocide prevention in Europe. How do border changes, nation-state formation, and the collapse and rise of empires trigger ethnic cleansing and genocide as occurred in the Ottoman Empire, the Second World War, and more recently in the post-Soviet conflicts in the former Yugoslavia? Lectures and discussions will delve into specific topics, such as the role of racism, anti-Semitism and biopolitics, the psychological responses of victims, the inclusion of rape as a genocidal war crime, the response of bystanders, perpetrator motivation, and trends in post-genocidal societies such as trials, memorialization and compensation.","755":"This course examines the reorientation of European thought in the secularization of culture and the beginning of the modern state in the 16th century; the new ideologies concerning the relation of the individual, society, and nature with the rise of modern science in the 17th century; the emergence of ideas and progress of evolution in the industrial and post-industrial revolutions of the 18th to 20th century; post-modern thought in the late 20th century.","756":"This course is designed to offer students a basic knowledge of late imperial Russian politics and culture, and to provide background for understanding the rise of Bolshevism and the Russian Revolution of 1917.","757":"This course analyzes Russian society and politics in the Soviet and Post-Soviet periods. Emphasis will be placed on the Russian revolutionary experience, on the origins and implications of Stalinism, on the Soviet Union after Stalin, and on the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991.","758":"This course is: (1) a study of Dostoevskii\u2019s life, his religious and ideological beliefs as articulated in major fictional and non-fictional works, his contributions to 19th-century debates about Russia\u2019s place in the world and its historical \u201cmission\u201d; (2) The Russian social, religious and ideological context(s) in which Dostoevskii operated.","759":"The objective of this course is to develop the skills needed to distinguish between reliable and unreliable historical arguments. We will examine several sensational arguments about the past that been widely discredited by professional historians - what might be called pseudohistory. The case studies touch on a wide range of regions, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. By comparing pseudohistorical works with serious works of history, and by studying the ways in which professional historians interpret evidence, we will define and analyze the basic elements of historical writing that make an argument trustworthy.","760":"Since the early 20th century, the portable camera has been one of the most powerful tools for representing and communicating suffering. Can we better understand the causes and consequences of violent conflicts and humanitarian responses through the history of visual culture and material objects? This survey of representations of war and genocide expands knowledge and understanding of the cause of conflicts, how they are waged and experienced, the making and undoing of empires and nation-states, and the emotional and social dimensions of war and forced displacement.","761":"This course examines Europe\u2019s 20th century as a series of \u201ctotal wars,\u201d from the Great War in 1914, through the Second World War and Holocaust, and concluding with the Cold War. It approaches these wars and genocide as a combination of military, economic, ideological, political, cultural, and social developments. The historical concept of \u201ctotal war\u201d will be discussed, and its horrific reality in modern Russia, Germany, France, England and the Soviet Union will be studied through the written, oral and visual accounts of political leaders, theorists, and ordinary individuals. Special attention will be paid to the themes of children at war, gendered aspects of warfare and genocide, and memory.","762":"A study of the transformation of German culture and society from 1919-1945. Begins with intellectual dilemmas of 19th-century Germany. Examines flourishing culture and political turmoils of Weimar democracy, Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, and Nazi perversions of culture. Focuses on literature, art, architecture, film, and music. Themes include the artist\u2019s role in society, the rise of modernism, art as propaganda, and responses to the Holocaust.","763":"This seminar examines gender and revolution in two intertwined ways. First, how do historical revolutions, including the Protestant and Catholic Reformations; New World colonialism and slavery; political revolutions, including the French Revolution; 19th-century feminism, and modern industrialization confront gender roles and the family? Second, how do gender, sexual, and familial identities undergo historical change and revolution?

After attention to several of the early novels, particularly Typee and Redburn, the focus will turn to the major novels, Moby Dick, Pierre, The Confidence Man, and Billy Budd, as well as the stories of The Piazza Tales. Melville\u2019s poetry, including the epic pilgrimage Clarel, will be considered in depth in the context of the Civil War and in relation to its ongoing spiritual occupations. Literary, religious, scientific, and political contexts will structure readings and discussions. Students are encouraged, though not required, to have taken a course in Shakespeare, the Bible, or Milton prior to enrollment.","838":"This course examines currents in American literature and film from World War II to the present. Though the course surveys key trends over this period \u2013 especially against the backgrounds of modernism and post-modernism \u2013 we will concentrate in particular on the \u201clyric\u201d impulse in American culture, studying works concerned with ideas of epiphany, meditation, contemplation, transcendence, a general conception of the \u201cpoetic\u201d and the role of feeling and the emotions in modern life. With a primary focus on short forms, we will pay special attention to work that confronts the question of how to maintain \u201clyric\u201d artistic standpoints amid cultural and social developments often inimical to them.","839":"The course will focus on poets whose poems display many of the virtues of memorable prose-clarity, vigor, sense, civility. These poets were engaged by the events of their time and wrote for literate readers who prized the sense of what they read-a general audience. The course will represent these poets\u2019 literary achievements, with special attention given to Pope\u2019s Essay on Man and Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Vanity of Human Wishes.\u201d All three poets left their mark, too, on the history of literary criticism. We will discuss Dryden\u2019s essays and prefaces, Pope\u2019s Essay on Criticism, and Johnson\u2019s Lives of the Poets.","840":"Emily Dickinson wrote more than 1,500 short poems, but not a single long poem, nor an essay. Her poems were unknown by nearly all her contemporaries. The poems have had immense impact, however, on later poets, and she has reached a very broad readership. She and Walt Whitman-altogether different from one another-are the most canonical of American poets. Her poems have come to stand for privacy, intensity, compression, and intellectuality. She wrote in a meter familiar to all those who have sung hymns in Christian churches. Her syntax and diction, though, are often peculiar, like that of no other English-language poet.","841":"An introduction to major American poets including Emerson, Whitman, Melville, Dickinson, Frost, Stevens, Eliot, Lowell, and others. Emphasis will be on basic concepts of metaphor, prosody, and myth and their relation to American thought.","842":"Close reading is what students and scholars of literature do, and have always done. This course will present an overview of the history of textual interpretation, from its roots in Biblical study and ancient philosophy to more modern approaches such as Marxist literary criticism, psychoanalytic literary criticism, hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, and deconstruction. To this end we will read theoretical texts by Erich Auerbach, Roland Barthes, William Empson, I. A. Richards, Jacques Derrida and others. The main focus of the class, however, will be individual readings of poetic texts. Poets studied include, but are not limited to, Shakespeare, Keats, Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, William Carlos Williams, and Yeats.","843":"This course is an introduction to major American poets of the last half century, from Lowell and Olson to Rich and Howe. We will consider poets and poems both individually and in their literary and socio-historical contexts, examining poetic movements (New York School, Beats, Black Mountain, Language), the relationship of poetry to the other arts, and the role of poetry in late-20th- and 21st-century culture. We will explore the formal experimentalism of postwar American poetry, its major thematic concerns (relations between art and politics, modernity and history, public and private), and its treatment of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation.","844":"The history of American poetry is unthinkable without the contribution of a central lineage of female poets. This course offers an in-depth examination of their work; we will open with the beginnings of the American literary tradition (Anne Bradstreet) and the nineteenth century (Emily Dickinson), then focus on twentieth-century poetry (from modernists Gertrude Stein and Marianne Moore to postwar poets Elizabeth Bishop and Sylvia Plath), and conclude by looking at exciting contemporary voices. We will consider poets and poems both individually and in their literary and socio-historical contexts, examining poetic movements (Imagism, Objectivism, the New York School, Confessionalism, Black Mountain, Language), the relationship of poetry to the other arts, and the role of poetry in American culture. While we will home in on gender poetics and politics, we will also explore broader questions of poetic form, the relations between modernity and history, and America and the world, as well as the poetic treatment of race, class, sexuality, and nation.","845":"This course will explore the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop and that of her two most important literary influences: the modernist poet and editor, Marianne Moore, who was her mentor; and her close literary peer, and fellow New Englander, Robert Lowell. While still a student at Vassar in the early thirties, Bishop met Moore and their friendship began. She and Lowell met in the mid-forties when they were both already established writers. Through close readings of the poems of these major American poets, students will open an inquiry into how friendship, in addition to artistic and temperamental differences, can influence and shape style.","846":"This course offers an examination of T.S. Eliot, one of the preeminent poets of the twentieth century. We will consider the entirety of Eliot\u2019s small output of poems and plays and many of his seminal critical essays, studying his relation to traditions of British, European, and classical poetry and his engagement with philosophical, moral, metaphysical, and religious questions. We will pay special attention to issues of modernism, poetic form, and intertextuality, to the idea of a poetic canon, and to the links between poetry and the other arts (music, painting, sculpture). We will also situate Eliot\u2019s work in the context of the broader sociocultural crisis of modernity in the first half of the twentieth century, as well as in its contemporary literary context, spending time on other poets whom Eliot admired and was influenced by, such as Pound and Yeats, but also on poets who rebelled against his influence, such as William Carlos Williams.","847":"In this course we will examine ancient Greek literature in the context of its culture, starting with the traditional foundations of Greek religion and heroic ideals embodied in epic, lyric, comedy, and tragedy. Then we will progress to the great period of questioning that followed, exemplified by the figure of Socrates, and expressed in the writings of philosophers and historians. Authors will include Homer, Simonides, Sappho, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, and Aristotle.","848":"Selected topics in Literature.","849":"What is a good book? How do we decide whether a work of literature is worth reading? What is the basis of literary judgment? How do we bring history, religion, and myth to bear on our understanding of literary texts? How does imaginative literature differ from other forms of discourse? These are among the fundamental questions explored in this course through the eyes of major literary thinkers. The course examines literary criticism as a discipline with unique traditions of inquiry beginning with classical debates about form and reality and the tensions between the moral and aesthetic dimensions of literature as they have been engaged by such writers as Plato and Aristotle, Sidney, Johnson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Arnold and Pater, Woolf, and Eliot.","850":"\u201cEvery allegedly great age is an age of translations\u201d: In this course we will test Ezra Pound\u2019s dictum by examining the history, theory, and practice of translation. What do translators-and translations-do? What is translation\u2019s role in the formation and transmission of culture? What is lost in translation and what may be gained? Bringing together readings from linguistics, literary criticism, philosophy, and anthropology, we will focus on case studies from ancient languages (the Bible, Greek classics) and pay special attention to literary translation in the 20th and 21st centuries. By also working on translations of their own, students will explore hands-on the interpretive and creative nature of the translator\u2019s task and the specific challenges that different types of translation pose; familiarity with a foreign language is welcome but not required.","851":"This course is designed to introduce students to the thorough, systematic study of poetry, thus increasing students\u2019 enjoyment of poetry and preparing them for advanced study of poetry in other courses. We will examine such issues as theories of poetry, form, poetic voice, symbolism and metaphorical language, irony, meter, and recurring themes as treated by poets of different backgrounds, in different cultural and historical contexts. The course will be organized thematically, but will include work by poets from the middle ages to the present.","852":"The course is first and foremost a course in the reading of poetry and its focus will thus be on poets such as Wallace Stevens, Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Sappho, Homer, Rainer Maria Rilke, Elizabeth Bishop and others. It will pay, however, special attention to the idea of poetry as such. What is poetry? What accounts for poets\u2019 different definitions of the activity? Does the nature of poetry change over time and across cultures? These will be the questions of the course and they will be explored through theoretical readings on poetry.","853":"Sophocles is regarded as the greatest of the Greek tragedians, in part because he could evoke such powerful tragic figures\u2013Oedipus, Ajax, Antigone, Heracles, Philoctetes. Based on the plays that have come down to us we will follow the arc of his career, comparing him with his great model, Aeschylus, and his chief rival, Euripides. The plays will be our window onto Athenian culture and the Dionysian festival for which they were written. They will lead us to consider the \u201cparadox of tragedy\u201d\u2013that we derive the most intense aesthetic pleasure from seeing the worst things happen to the best people.","854":"This course will give an overview of the main conceptions of the relationship between poetry and philosophy in Western culture, from classical antiquity to the present. It will proceed through a series of questions. The first of these are: What is poetry? What is philosophy? How might they best relate to one another? Why does Plato refer to an \u201cancient enmity\u201d between poetry and philosophy? Why might there be tension between the two activities? How might they be harmonized? What is the relation of reason to imagination?","855":"The chivalric ideal was a complex social and behavioral code that governed the life of the medieval court, from the battlefield to the bedroom. In addition to the early legends of Tristan, Parzival, and Lancelot, we\u2019ll examine late medieval practical guides for aspiring knights written by Raymon Lull, Geoffrey de Charny, and Andreas Capellanus. Other readings will include Marie de France\u2019s fanciful Arthurian Lais, Chaucer\u2019s Knight\u2019s Tale, and Malory\u2019s Mort D\u2019Arthur. Key issues to be examined include the chivalric ethos, changing definitions of medieval masculinity, representations of women in chivalric texts, medieval identity performance in tournaments and pageants, and contemporary medievalisms, from Camelot to Monty Python.","856":"This course introduces students to one of the most influential authors of medieval Europe. We\u2019ll explore themes related to sin and punishment, love and lust, commerce and trade, and the complicated relationship between author and text. We\u2019ll also meet corrupt friars, lusty nuns, shady merchants, and even a person described as \u201cthe worst man in the world.\u201d In addition to reading Dante\u2019s Vita Nuova, Divine Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso), and excerpts from the Convivio and Monarchia, students will also read Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s riotous Life of Dante, written just decades after Dante\u2019s death. At the end of the course, we\u2019ll emerge from the depths of hell onto the bustling streets of Florence with selected stories from Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron. All readings will be in English translation.","857":"What constitutes the ideal state? The ideal ruler? These questions lie at the center of the extraordinary flourishing of political thought in Europe between 1500 and 1700. At the same time, they deeply engaged the literary imagination of the period, as authors held the mirror up to their own societies, reconstructed societies of the past, and described societies of their own imaginative making. In this course we will explore the complex and compelling intersection between early modern politics and literature, paying particular attention to the uses and representations of violence. Our readings will include works by Shakespeare, Machiavelli, Elizabeth I, Montaigne, Milton, Hobbes, and others.","858":"The longstanding tradition of bardolatry, or Shakespeare worship, has given us a mythical figure that bestrides the narrow world like a colossus. But the historical Shakespeare was once a young writer trying to make a name for himself in the bustling world of London theater. There he had not only contemporaries but also competitors. In this course we will read a group of Shakespeare\u2019s plays next to and against those of his rivals, including Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson. We will carefully consider such matters as style, stagecraft, genre, history, moral philosophy, and the representation of difference.","859":"In this seminar we will explore the ways in which individuals take possession of and authority over their lives through the act of writing. The impulse behind this act varies: sometimes it might be to justify the life that has been lived so far; sometimes it might be to explore the life not lived at all, an expression of regret; sometimes it might be an attempt to conceal events consciously or not, from both the reader and the author.","860":"From the plague to the peasants\u2019 revolt, this course examines critical moments in the cultural history of England by looking at the literature of the court, the city, the church, and the countryside. Key topics addressed over the course of the semester will include urbanization, lay piety, anticlericalism, literacy, cosmopolitanism, gender politics, labor, and national identity. Students will read a wide range of genres including epic poetry, fabliau, sermons, saints\u2019 lives, dream visions, and drama Readings will include Pearl, Gower\u2019s Confessio Amantis, Langland\u2019s Piers Plowman, and excerpts from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and shorter poems.","861":"A study of the revolution in human consciousness known as Romanticism. The course concentrates on the British Romantics, but also studies Romanticism as an international phenomenon. Writers studied include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Rousseau, Goethe, Schiller, Emerson, Thoreau, Lermontov.","862":"This course examines the explosive growth of the Russian novel. Students will read major works by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy and will become familiar with such themes as Slavophilism, realism, revolution versus tradition, and national identity.","863":"Modernism was characterized by radical experiments in form that altered the conventions of what we think of as literature. Inseparable from these technical innovations were the cultural forces that shaped writers of the period, including the trauma of war, the rise of mass culture, new technologies such as radio, cinema, and photography, and changed patterns of mobility, urban experience, and sexual freedom. But modernism\u2019s relentless quest for the new was accompanied by an attraction to the very old, as writers turned to Greek antiquity and the Celtic past to forge their aesthetics. This course approaches the modernist movement through some of its most prominent figures (Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot) and examines distinctive techniques including Imagism, stream-of-consciousness, and the mythic method.","864":"The first half of the 20th century produced an exceptional body of powerful and innovative fiction. Modernist fiction is notable for its stylistic originality, formal experimentation, psychological depth, sensuality, wit, nostalgia, and irony. Authors will include Conrad, Joyce, Ford, Woolf, Lawrence, Kafka, Proust, Gide, Mann, and others.","865":"War pervades literature as thoroughly as it has pervaded human history. This course studies the depiction of war from the American Civil War to the recent past in selected works of literature and film. While the course examines the many-sided nature of war, its main emphasis is on the following three areas: ethics in war; military leadership; and the tension between idealism and disillusionment. Texts to be studied include Crane\u2019s The Red Badge of Courage, Remarque\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front, Babel\u2019s Red Cavalry, Orwell\u2019s Homage to Catalonia, Jones\u2019s The Thin Red Line, as well as the work of various poets and essayists.","866":"This course will introduce English and Irish poetry of the 20th century, with special attention to the central figures of Hardy, Yeats, and Auden, but also including, among others, Houseman, Hopkins, the poets of World War One, Dylan Thomas, Larkin, Hughes, and Heaney.","867":"The course will explore the thematic and structural affinities between poetry and painting from classical antiquity to the present day. Each class will be structured around the study and discussion of a single painting or poem selected from among the materials for that week. The class will cultivate the practice of careful, slow reading and seeing. Readings for the course will discuss the relationship between the two arts, the notion of arts being connected, and notions of what role art might play in life.","868":"Since 1945 the novel has increasingly become an international genre, with a reading public and lines of influence between writers that transcend the boundaries of language and nation. This course will consider a selection of the most important and influential works written in this period in America and abroad. Texts will include Invisible Man, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Go Down, Moses, On a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveler\u2026, The Kiss of the Spider Woman, A Clockwork Orange, Labyrinths, Beloved, V., Midnight\u2019s Children, and Pale Fire.","869":"This course introduces students to some of the most influential literary and vernacular texts emerging from the African American cultural context. For the most part, these literary and vernacular works will be considered in relation to the historical moments in which they were produced. This historicized approach will provoke class discussions primarily focused on the way in which black literary production chronicled, reflected, and contributed to African America\u2019s varied, vexed relation to the American \u201cdemocratic project.\u201d Attention to history will also lead students into considerations of the intimate connection between the aesthetic choices of African American writers and the evolving legal and social statuses of black people in America.","870":"We will begin with a close analysis of a contemporary popular film, in an effort to determine typical conventions of cinematic expression, and then proceed through a study of multiple movements and genres in the history of film, from German Expressionism to the French New Wave, from Hollywood to documentary to avant-garde and independent film-making. Overall, the course is intended to provide students with a broad introduction to film analysis and to the field of Film Studies.","871":"This course surveys the history of cinema as art and mass medium, from the introduction of sound to the rise of the \u201cNew Hollywood.\u201d Topics such as cinematic response to World War II, the decline of the studio system, and \u201cnew waves\u201d of European film-making are studied in social, cultural, and aesthetic perspectives.","872":"This course surveys the history of cinema as art and mass medium, from 1965 to the present. Topics such as the rise of independent filmmaking in America, the conglomeration of the studios, and European resistance to Hollywood\u2019s domination on the world market are considered in social, cultural, and aesthetic terms.","873":"This course examines correspondences and affinities between literature and film in aesthetic, cultural, and social contexts. Throughout, we will look not only at specific case studies of literary adaptation or cross-reference, but consider the larger questions of cultural value implied in these transactions. Writers and film-makers to be considered include Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Carson McCullers, Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, and Robert Altman.","874":"A seminar designed to explore the aesthetic achievement and social impact of film as an art form. Subjects for study include such topics as specific film genres, the work of individual film-makers, and recurring themes in film. Each year the seminar concentrates on a different area - for example, \u201cFilm and Politics,\u201d \u201cThe Director as Author,\u201d or \u201cViolence and the Hero in American Films.\u201d","875":"This course examines the work and legacy of Alfred Hitchcock from cultural, social, historical and artistic perspectives. Special attention will be paid to Hitchcock\u2019s work in relation to cultural modernism and social modernity, and to his influence on both avant-garde and commercial cinemas, including the French New Wave (1959-1968) and the New Hollywood (1967-1975).","876":"Mainstream genres can be seen as expressions of American culture\u2019s popular mythology. This course will concentrate on selected genres to examine the social values, issues, and tensions that underlie these narratives and their characteristic ways of resolving fundamental societal conflicts.","877":"This is a survey of gay and lesbian cinema in the U.S. from the early 20th century to the present. The course examines depictions of gay\/lesbian themes in Classical Hollywood cinema of the 20s-60s, as well as more recent examples including Sylvia Scarlett, Tea and Sympathy, The Children\u2019s Hour, The Killing of Sister George, Poison, Swoon, Watermelon Woman, and Brokeback Mountain.","878":"This course will examine film as art and as medium in the context of the rise of 20th-century \u201cmass culture.\u201d We will take up such topics as the role of film in producing the ideas of \u201cmass culture\u201d, the cinematic representation of the \u201cmasses\u201d, film as an instrument of the standardization of culture and as a mode of resistance to it, film and modernism, film and postmodernism, representations of fascism in cinema, and \u201csubculture\u201d considered as an effect of mass culture.","879":"This course investigates the major film theories from the beginnings of cinema to the present. We begin with a study of classical film theory (1900-1960) that attempts to define the essence of the form, its relation to reality, and its status as mass medium and\/or art. We then move on to more recent work that examines film from ideological, sociological, or psychological perspectives, or considers the changing nature of cinema in the digital age.","880":"The Irish poet William Butler Yeats, one of the \u201clast romantics,\u201d as he called himself, was considered by T. S. Eliot to be \u201cthe greatest poet of our time \u2014 certainly the greatest in this language, and as far as I am able to judge, in any language.\u201d Love, art, history, politics, and the supernatural are his central themes. Yeats is a central figure of High Modernism, but among modernists his poetry remains distinctively personal. In this course we will trace Yeats\u2019 fifty-year career, from the early days of the Celtic Twilight in the 1890s to the great poems of old age written on the brink of World War II and including Yeats\u2019s contribution to the Irish national theater.","881":"Utopia is a literary genre that attempts to imagine how human societies can be reformed to eliminate violence, irrationality, waste, and chaos. Utopias attempt, in other words, to eliminate everything that makes literature-and life-interesting. Is that why utopia so often leads to dystopia? In this course, we will follow utopian and dystopian thinking and writing from classical times into the late twentieth century. Works will include More\u2019s Utopia, New Atlantis, Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Candide, Looking Backward, Brave New World, 1984, A Clockwork Orange (book and film), The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and The Matrix (film).","882":"Reading and analysis of novels, poetry, and essays representing the most important trends in modern Caribbean literature.","883":"A study of the origins and impact of nihilism in modern literature.

Attention given to questions of identity, exile, history, memory, and language. Authors include Jean Rhys, Paule Marshall, Maryse Conde, Jamaica Kincaid, Edwidge Danticat, and Michelle Cliff.","887":"Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud have exerted a dominant influence not only upon literary criticism but upon the entire intellectual culture of advanced modernity. We will study a selection of their works in a broad cultural context, beginning with Enlightenment precursors like Voltaire and Rousseau, taking account of important contemporaries like Darwin, and ending with postmodernist disciples like Thomas Pynchon and Michel Foucault.","888":"In the writings of the psychologist Sigmund Freud, the fabulist Franz Kafka, and the novelist Robert Musil, twentieth century German-language culture produced three of the most significant expressions of modernity in crisis.

This course will explore the art of oratory from ancient Greece to modern America. Examination of speeches of Demosthenes, Pericles, Cicero, Burke, Webster, Lincoln, Churchill, Martin Luther King, and others will be combined with study of theories of oratory and rhetoric from Aristotle to Wayne Booth.

Speech writing and performance will form a practical component of this course.","890":"This is a class for the student who is serious about writing fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. There will be frequent short assignments for workshop discussion and a longer final one.","891":"In this seminar we will read the major writings of the Irish author James Joyce, whose work was immensely influential on all 20th-century literature, in English and in other languages. We will begin with his collection of short stories, Dubliners, and with his quasi-autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The greater part of our class will be devoted to a detailed reading of Ulysses, his epic of the modern world. Time permitting, we will study excerpts of Finnegans Wake to establish strategies for reading this compendium of language and history.","892":"This advanced fiction workshop is intended for people who have taken at least one semester of Fiction Writing (LIT 038 CM ). Each student will submit two stories or novel excerpts for workshop, where they will be carefully critiqued by the class. We\u2019ll also read short fiction by well-known contemporary writers, with an eye toward what makes these stories original, entertaining, and complex. In class, we\u2019ll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer. How do we avoid clich\u00e9? Create narrative drive? Take risks with form, language, and subject matter? Written exercises will focus on these issues while challenging students to push their writing in unexpected directions.","893":"This is an intermediate and advanced undergraduate poetry writing workshop for those who wish to improve their craft as poets while broadening their knowledge of poetry. Much of the term will be devoted to weekly exercises as preparation for later \u201cfree-assignments.\u201d Poems by students will be discussed in a \u201cworkshop\u201d format with attention to the process of revision.

A final portfolio of six thoroughly revised poems will be required for completion of the course.","894":"An examination of the poetry and prose of Robert Frost, one of the preeminent American poets. Consideration will be given to Frost\u2019s work in relation to traditions of pastoral poetry and classical authors, his innovations in blank verse and English metrics, his dialogue with science and pragmatism, and his thinking about the nature of metaphor and poetic drama. Careful attention will be given to Frost\u2019s ambivalent relationship to literary modernism, American predecessors, especially Emerson, Thoreau, and Dickinson, his reaction to the New Deal and the Cold War, and the complex history of Frost biography.","895":"This is a two-week lab course taken prior to the start of the fall semester that provides an intensive review of key practices in finance and accounting. The sessions include networking opportunities and workshops to help students improve their professional conduct and develop their networking, communication and career management skills.

The course will prepare students for leadership roles in firms as entrepreneurs, CEOs or senior managers, venture capital and private equity investors as well as senior positions in consultancy, regulatory, and non-profit sectors.","903":"This course will introduce students to the language of business and finance (accounting). Financial accounting is concerned with how firms report the results of their operations to outsiders such as investors, analysts, and regulatory agencies. An appreciation of the role of financial reporting in our economic system and insights into how financial accounting information is used by decision-makers both inside and outside the firm are essential for those who are seeking careers in finance. The emphasis is more on concepts than on procedures. The course will discuss some of the recent accounting scandals, the reasons behind them and how we can eliminate such problems. The course will also introduce the students to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the debate about the role of accounting in the financial crisis.","904":"Students who have the necessary qualifications and who wish to investigate an area of study not covered in regularly scheduled courses may arrange for independent study under the direction of a faculty reader.

We will look at traditional approaches to justifying religious belief\u2014such as the design argument and Pascal\u2019s wager\u2014as well as modern approaches\u2014such as Plantinga\u2019s \u201creformed epistemology\u201d and appeals to research on happiness. We will conclude by asking whether belief per se is really a core part of being religious.","998":"Skepticism about a particular subject matter is the view that nothing can be known about that subject matter. This course surveys various types of skepticism\u2013such as external-world skepticism, religious skepticism, moral skepticism, and scientific skepticism\u2013and the interesting relationships among them. We will also be paying close attention to the way in which skepticism interacts with more practical matters\u2013e.g., if you have no reason to believe that the external world exists, do you still have reason to get out of bed in the morning?","999":"Every day, we casually sort our judgments into categories. If a belief isn\u2019t well-supported, we might say that it is just a guess. If a belief is well-supported, we might say that it is knowledge. In between, we distinguish things like hunches, educated guesses, and reasonable beliefs. These and related distinctions play a fundamental role in our personal and legal relationships. But how, exactly, should we draw these distinctions? What, for example, makes a belief reasonable as opposed to unreasonable? This course introduces students to the basics of epistemology, which seeks to refine and answer these questions.","1000":"An exploration of issues in the philosophy of language and, in particular, the relation between language and the world.

Do we have a free will? Is free will compatible with determinism? What are we doing when we deliberate about what do do? Would it make sense to believe determinism is true and yet still deliberate about what to do? What is it to hold someone responsible? Is this compatible with determinism? What is determinism? Is it true? Can punishment be justified in a manner consistent with reflection on the nature of freedom of the will, responsibility, and determinism?","1002":"This course will address the question \u201cWhat makes an action moral or immoral?\u201d In the process of answering it, students will be introduced to the techniques that philosophers use to resolve ethical problems and to some of the greatest works of ethical philosophy in the Western canon, including works by Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill.","1003":"Metaethics inquires about the nature of values and value judgments. Are values real? Imaginary? Constructed? When we judge that something is good or bad, what are we doing? Are we making testable observations? Expressing our positive and negative feelings? Asserting universal truths? Asserting culturally relative truths? Talking about fictional entities? Metaethics also inquires into the nature of moral motivation. Can we be motivated do what we believe is right just by the belief that it is right? Related topics include the nature of moral expertise, the relationship between values and reasons, and the relationship between reasons and motivation.","1004":"This course covers special topics in value theory, including special topics in ethical theory, applied ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.

Why do we sometimes act against our own best judgment? Do we have free will? When is it appropriate to praise and blame people for what they\u2019ve done? What is the proper role of moral emotions such as love or shame? Does love entitle you to show preference to your loved ones?","1007":"Participants in this course will first examine prominent theories of law, including positivism and recent variations upon natural law and legal realist approaches.

How do employees\u2019 differences influence their interactions? Are these differences detrimental, beneficial, or both? What do we know about leveraging team diversity to attain positive outcomes? These questions will be addressed in this course. More specifically, students will learn about (1) the state-of-the-science from both the teams and diversity literature, (2) the many emergent states and processes that diverse teams go through in organizations, and (3) the tools and interventions to maximize the benefit of diverse teams in the workplace.","1085":"This course examines the role of communication in the development and perpetuation of organizational culture.

Comparative methodology used to examine a significant number of specific themes in each religious tradition.","1095":"This course introduces three major South Asian religious traditions - Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism - focusing on devotional movements and practices within each. We will consider medieval-to-modern South Asia as a site of rich literary and religious dialogue and exchange, and devotional expressions and practices (poetic, musical, visual, performative, meditative) as products of both the distinct traditions that claim them and the diverse religious landscapes in which they take place. Topics include the esoteric or \u201cmystical\u201d; place and community; saints and gurus; and reform, debate and dissent.","1096":"This course examines myth in the context of religious thought and how it has been interpreted in ancient and contemporary societies. The course surveys various types of myth and the theoretical understandings of them. Students apply these models of understanding to myths from ancient Babylonian, Greek, Australian, Indian, and Native American traditions.","1097":"Through readings from classical Jewish texts (e.g. Bible, Talmud, Midrash, philosophy, mysticism), popular literature (e.g. memoirs, short stories), and contemporary scholarship, the course explores the history of Jews and Jewish communities, major textual and intellectual traditions that have defined Jewish life, and the various constructions of Jewish identity articulated through its texts, beliefs, and practices.","1098":"Drawing on historical and contemporary sources, this course is a study of major Western religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Comparative methodology used to examine significant themes and issues in each religious tradition.","1099":"Explores the history of Christianity from Jesus to the present in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

This course will consider the historical context of Sikhism\u2019s emergence and development in the Punjabi homeland; Sikh theology, ritual, and practice; and the Sikh diaspora in the U.S. and elsewhere. Within these areas of inquiry we will also engage with key themes from the tradition, including scripture and authority; martyrdom and violence; identity (from gender and sexuality to caste, class, and the turban); and politics (including Partition, the Khalistan movement, 1984, and Sikhs in post-9\/11 America). We will watch several films and will visit a local Gurudwara (a Sikh place of worship).","1102":"The course examines Jewish history and constructions of identity through the art work produced by Jews from antiquity to the present. Jews have used a variety of visual artistic media (e.g., mosaics, paintings, architecture) to express their central beliefs, create spaces of holiness, articulate notions of Jewish identity, and formulate collective memories, an important process in the creation and maintenance of Jewish identity. Some of the topics covered are ancient synagogue art, Medieval illuminated manuscripts, Holocaust art, and modern European, American, and Israeli art, including the work of Oppenheim, Chagall, Shahn, Soyer, Rothko, Lilien, Rubin, Zaritsky, Ardon, and Nes.","1103":"This course is an introduction to Islamic political thought, with special attention paid to the contributions of the Fatimid Empire (909-1171). The Fatimids, who controlled a large portion of the Mediterranean, brought about a number of remarkable achievements under their rule: the founding of Cairo; unprecedented ritual pageantry surrounding the leader, the caliph-imam; and major advancements in theology, arts, and sciences. In this course we will think through major issues in the way political philosophy helped to guide the empire-issues such as the role of apocalypticism as a revolutionary theology; the place of secrecy in governing; and how religious symbolism could explain declines in political power. As the Fatimids were Shia, we will also cover various similarities and differences between Sunni and Shia political philosophies.","1104":"Apocalypticism remains one of the most potent and enduring dimensions of human religiosity. Apocalyptic symbolism has been implicated in the rise and renewal of major religious traditions, revolutions (of both \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d varieties), and major historical events. The events of the apocalypse have also provided material for some of the most creative expressions of artistic, literary, and cultural phenomena throughout human history. This course explores some of the ways in which the apocalyptic is expressed across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and beyond while also addressing key theoretical concerns in apocalyptic studies.","1105":"Belief in the unseen and belief in the afterworld became accepted widely as two major tenets of Islamic theology. How Muslims envisioned and continue to envision the hidden is the subject of this course. We will examine a broad range of materials from a wide range of geographic areas and time periods-from artistic depictions to Sufi manuals, from messianic movements to Egyptian interpretations of Freud-to address paradigms of \u201cseeing\u201d in these traditions. In our explorations, we will, too, trace how these visions relate to events on the plane of history.","1106":"How does religion change across time and space? This course examines the ways in which Islamic concepts, symbols, and discourses change across different geographies and time periods. In our explorations, we are particularly interested in (1) cataloging the vast diversity of Islamic expressions in different times and places, particularly in South and Southeast Asia; (2) exploring how actors in these different regions and eras may make claims about \u2018authentic\u2019 Islam; and (3) exploring how language associated with these authoritative claims often presents Islam as unchanging. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Islam.","1107":"Many contemporary scholars of Islamic Studies lament that the study of Islam is hampered by both religious and political forces. Through a focused examination of the history of the study of Islam in European and North American academies-including Orientalism and its critiques-this course will assess the merit of this claim while isolating what those forces might be. We will examine three specific areas of contemporary scholarship-violence, gender, and modernity-to situate scholarly arguments, ascertain how scholars are making their arguments, and think through what they might be arguing against. We will also examine materials advocating for reform of Islamic Studies, envisioning what a shift in disciplinary boundaries might look like.","1108":"A cross-cultural and trans-historical exploration of the phenomenon of witchcraft (the use of magical means to harm or help others) with a special focus on indigenous religions, folk religions, and contemporary Wicca. Topics covered will include theories of how magic works and fits into larger religions and cultural systems; the role that witchcraft accusations have played historically, especially in 16th and 17th century Europe; and why some contemporary practitioners of magic identify themselves as \u201cwitches.\u201d","1109":"An exploration of matriarchal, woman-centered, and\/or goddess-worshiping societies historically and cross-culturally, both real and imagined, and an extended discussion of what is at stake in exploring, studying, or inventing such societies. This course will include readings from historians, philosophers, theologians, novelists, economists, archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians of religion, among others.","1110":"This course offers an introduction to African American religions. The course moves chronologically, examining African religions in the Americas, cultural continuities between African and African American religions, slave religion, and the development of independent African American churches. We will examine the rise of African-American new religious movements such as Father Divine and the Nation of Islam, and the religious dimensions of the Civil Rights Movement. Moving through African-American religious history, we will consider topics such as slave resistance, gender and race, and emigration to Africa.","1111":"The course examines the influence of religion on white supremacy and the civil rights movement in the United States from the 1950\u2019s through the 1970\u2019s. In particular, it explores how religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and narratives were incorporated and employed as strategies and mechanisms for social change in the African American, Mexican American\/Chicano, and American Indian (AIM) civil rights struggles. It will focus on how key leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Ralph Abernathy, Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina, Dolores Huerta, Dennis Banks, and others drew on their religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and counter-narratives in their struggles against white supremacy, segregation, political disenfranchisement, and for civil rights and social justice.","1112":"The course surveys the history of the state of Israel, from its ideological beginnings in Jewish tradition and the modern Zionist movement to contemporary religious, political, and social issues. Two areas receive focused attention. The first examines the contrasting and sometimes conflicting Zionist ideologies and the legacy of these ideas as they express themselves in Israel from 1948 to the present. The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel (e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi), and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, Arab\/Palestinian, citizens.","1113":"Legend says that the blues were born at a Southern Crossroads when a young black American sold his soul to the Devil to play the guitar. In fact, the \u201cCrossroads\u201d have represented opportunity, danger, and spiritual power across a variety of religious traditions in the Americas. And it is no coincidence that, as a physical space, crossroads have served as a natural locus for human exchange, both economic and cultural. This course explores the Crossroads as an entr\u00e9e into the field of religion and economy in the Americas. It examines contact points between Western European Christian and African diasporic religion in the U.S. and Brazil, while critically assessing how capitalism has shaped religious life across the hemisphere.","1114":"The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is one of two great Hindu epics composed roughly at the turn of the common era.

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like \u201cthe market\u201d and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift\/maintenance\/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay and uses films alongside readings to explore each unit\u2019s key topics.","1181":"Archaeology is one of the four primary subdivisions of Anthropology. The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior. Letter grade only.","1182":"This course is designed to provide an overview of the field of applied anthropology.

That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the \u201cwriting on the walls of the prison house of culture,\u201d a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a \u201cmatter of life and death.\u201d We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation. Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film your own essay.

ChaseCredit: 1 Interpretations of the past are made primarily through archaeology and written history. If writtenhistory does not exist, then archaeological data are used to frame past life ways. Variousarchaeological techniques and strategies exist for collecting and interpreting data, all of which isgathered through combinations of survey, mapping, and excavation. Different techniques forassembling and presenting these data may lead to differences in interpretation. This course isdesigned to provide students with an introduction to archaeological field methods, covering howand why materials are excavated and mapped in the field as well as the basic tool set that isavailable for archaeology. Archaeological field methods are best learned in conjunction within-fieldarchaeological research; the readings and discussions are meant to supplement the actual practiceof archaeology in the field. The conjunction of reading and practice should better inform theacquisition of archaeological knowledge and skills. Emphasis also will be placed on the nature ofthe archaeological interpretation in terms of excavation techniques and contexts that arespecifically focused on the ancient Maya.

What sorts of histories become apparent when looking at the emergence of particular kinds of infrastructures? How can we approach questions of environmental justice by studying the mundane infrastructures of daily life? Which communities are made more vulnerable to risk by particular kinds of infrastructure planning, and how can we address these questions using qualitative, ethnographic methods?

The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists\u2019 inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino\/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over \u2018illegality\u2019 further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino\/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship.

Letter grade only.","1339":"Latin\/o\/a\/xs have historically used grassroots community organizing and social movement participation to press for socio-political change. Yet, national discourse often falls back on stereotypes of Latino\/as\u2019 political apathy. This class will explore competing definitions of political participation. By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino\/a\/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of \u201cLatino\/a\u201d social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants\u2019 rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino\/a social movements historically.","1340":"Organized into two parts, this workshop-based class provides a collective space to learn about, document and engage with the current struggles for sanctuary in our local communities.

Can I be good? Is morality objective, subjective or relative to one\u2019s society? What is the relation between gods and humans? Are we at the mercy of fate?","1372":"From the rage-filled rivalries of Homer\u2019s heroes to the Hellenistic game of thrones launched by Alexander the Great, vigorous debates about the character and consequences of (good) leadership were a prominent feature of ancient Greek literature and politics (ca. 750-300 B.C.). Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized. Our seminar readings will include both modern scholarship and ancient sources, the latter drawn primarily from Homer\u2019s Iliad, from the historiographies of Herodotus and Thucydides, and from the writings of the fourth-century scholar-warrior Xenophon (including his Socratic Memorabilia, his campaign memoir Anabasis, and his Cyropaedia, an extended meditation on the ideal leader).

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.","1439":"In the United States, and generally in Western Europe, most individuals think of dance in three ways: 1.

Why do some policies fail? The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution. Instead, the objective of this course is to develop some habits of mind that enable the students see the world of politics through the analytical lens of economics. .","1482":"Benefit-cost analysis is an important analytical tool that is used worldwide to decide which public projects to pursue and what regulations are viable.

Tracing Ovid\u2019s narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of \u201caffordance\u201d encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the \u201cvivid\u201d style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.","1508":"Practice in a literary form, with some attention to technical theory and to the creative process.

Texts range from the travel narratives of Lewis and Clark and Mark Twain to the social protests of John Rollin Ridge and Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton to the modernist experiments of Nathanael West, Joan Didion, and Don DeLillo. Through this broad survey of western American literature, students encounter a variety of voices competing over the symbolic and the manifest representation of a highly coveted territorial space.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an \u201cunfinished event?\u201d The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.","1523":"Novels, anti- and pro-slavery tracts, domestic manuals and other forms of women\u2019s writing during the 19th century.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: \u201cshe walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son\u2019s rhythm is different.\u201d A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called \u201cHow to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces.\u201d At the heart of the course was Barthes\u2019 concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of \u201cindividual rhythms\u201d that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes\u2019 notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: \u201cspaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living.\u201d How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we\u2019ll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to \u201ccontent.\u201d Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.","1530":"This course will focus on canonical and non-canonical Asian American poetry; particularly, how that body of work has been read, regarded, and taught, as well how it has been included or excluded more generally in American Studies. We will examine discussions and scholarship regarding Asian American poetry and poetics that have deepened in the last twenty-five years. In addition, the course will engage with the emergent and established communities that have formed by and for Asian American poets from the mid-twentieth century to the present. This class will also examine and situate the work of Asian American poets as located both inside and outside a mainstream white culture. We will explore the poetry and poetics of Asian American poets from the second half of the twentieth-century to contemporary twenty first-century poetry, particularly following three categories of poetic form: narrative, lyric, and nontraditional writing. This focus on form will include work off the page, performance, spoken word, and avant-garde work. Not only will the course explore multifaceted traditions in poetry but we will also look at both the theories of categorization and the politics that are always at stake for the poetries and poets. Letter grade only.","1531":"This course will explore the rich and overlapping ways to read poetry and examine visual, performative, intermedial, artist\u2019s and textual poetics.

But the question is what sort of thing that nothing might be? And whether it can be known or experienced. In this seminar we will investigate some or all of the following: birdsong and other animal utterances; the grammar of colonialism; mystical languages of unsaying; the task of the translator; the transmission of the incomprehensible; the writing of the disaster; speaking in tongues. Although we will be reading ancient and modern texts, our particular emphasis will be on materials from the Middle Ages, that is, the last era before the capitalist schism that has led to the technocratic dream in which we now toil. Readings may include works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius, Anselm, Milarepa, Ibn Arabi, Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France, Dante, Chaucer, Margery Kempe, Nebrija, the Inca Garcilaso, Mirabai, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Benjamin, Agamben, and the anonymous authors of the Cloud of Unknowing and the Vimalakirti Sutra.","1534":"An examination of Shakespeare\u2019s earlier plays.

Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein\u2019s creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women\u2019s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.","1538":"Examinations of Joyce\u2019s works: Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, Exiles and Ulysses. Close reading of the texts and consideration of aspects of Joyce\u2019s personal background, relation to previous literary history and great influence upon contemporary literature. (H5, SA)","1539":"This course brings canonical works together with U.S. minority literatures to examine the representations of race and ethnicity in 19th-century American national culture. Readings take a comparative approach that considers multiple races and ethnicitieis; for instance, Herman Melville\u2019s \u201cBenito Cereno\u201d and its representation of an African American slave insurrection will be studied in conjunction with John Rollin Ridge\u2019s contemporaneous \u201cThe Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta,\u201d a novel depicting a Mexican hero-turned-bandit in Gold Rush California. All readings will be contextualized with and illuminated by a variety of historical discourses and more recent critical theory. Final assignment include a research project on outside material.","1540":"What is an essay? What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere \u2018throughout history, and across the globe\u2019 they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. (\u2018Essay,\u2019 from the French verb \u2018essai,\u2019 to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create \u2018strange bridges\u2019 where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form\u2019s origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay\u2019s protean potential to the fullest. Possible authors include Chimamanda Adichie, Theodor Adorno, Germ\u251c\u00edn Arciniegas, Francis Bacon, James Baldwin, Roland Barthes, Jose Luis Borges, Frances Burney, Anne Carson, Margaret Cavendish, Catherine Chung, Teju Cole, Joan Didion, Gerald Early, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Ross Gay, Roxane Gay, Samuel Johnson, Jamaica Kincaid, Yiyun Li, Valeria Luiselli, Georg Luk\u251c\u00edcs, Toni Morrison, Maggie Nelson, George Orwell, Alfonso Reyes, Mary Shelley, Julietta Singh, Susan Sontag, Virginia Woolf, Oscar Wilde, Gabriel Zaid.","1541":"This course examines the guardian as an evolving legal category, as a character populating that \u2018form for orphans,\u2019 the novel, and as a model for the literary persona of the novelist. Through readings in legal texts as well as novels by Richardson, Austen, Dickens, and James, we will ask how guardianship intersects with such concepts as ownership, representation, and especially authorship. We will explore the reader\u2019s role as ward, and we will glance at guardianship\u2019s bearing on histories of slavery, voting rights, and aesthetics, on contemporary problems such as mass incarceration and our failing stewardship of the earth, and on the novel genre\u2019s many debts to drama.","1542":"The great modernist writers\u2013T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, &c\u2013were at the same time brilliant propagandists, creating the aesthetic system by which their works would be enjoyed. They also, along the way, created the first self-conscious literary period. In this course we\u2019ll read fiction, poetry, and critical prose by the founders of Anglo-American literary modernism, looking at the values it supported as well as those it occluded\u2013the voices it supported and those it made much more difficult to hear. .","1543":"The social sciences have an account of art. What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology \u2018the folklore of white supremacy.\u2019 Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, \u2018desirable things\u2019 that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler\u2019s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a \u2018type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.\u2019 Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","1544":"This interdisciplinary course focuses on the writings of Ralph Ellison as a cornerstone of the African American literary tradition, and as a theorist whose literary work, theoretical engagements, and cultural criticism helped lay the foundations of the Civil Rights Movement, African Diaspora theory, Afrofuturism, Afropessimism, and Afropunk.","1545":"This course explores Herman Melville\u2019s writing across multiple genres from Typee to Billy Budd and including Moby Dick.

Characteristic of all of the poet\u2019s works is an uncompromising irony; a filthy sense of humor; and, perhaps, a mystical knowledge of the true nature of things.

In this course, we will read some of the major literary works of this period with reference to various social and historical contexts. How did American authors process the trauma of war in Europe and Vietnam, on the one hand, and respond to the United States\u2019 increasing political and economic centrality in a global context, on the other? How did the Cold War and the specter of Communism, and domestic social movements such as the civil rights movement, the New Left, and feminism affect literary history (and vice versa)?

How does it differ from other forms of human communication, representation, and knowledge? How can we assess the meaning, value, and historical significance of individual literary works, and understand the functions and effects of specific genres, tropes, and tendencies?

How, and under what conditions, does literature reflect or intersect with history, politics, sexuality, race, and other social phenomena? These are some of the questions that literary theorists, critics, and philosophers have asked in the 20th and 21st centuries.

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a \u2018nonfiction novel\u2019 in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of \u2018autofiction\u2019)? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel\u2019s tradition, given the form\u2019s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities.

These sophisticated tools for modeling complex socio-spatial relationships are continually simplified with easy- to-follow drop-down menus and of-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications, expanding the user-base of map-makers. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps to reveal hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. We will critically engage with ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software \u2013 to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.This course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks where students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement valuing the contributions of all classroom participants and allowing for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS. .","1565":"An examination of the idea of nature and wilderness in American history, from colonial visions to contemporary ideologies.

We begin by reviewing the hydrologic cycle and discussing the physical processes that occur in headwater streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Early seminars introduce the chemical processes and \u2018signatures\u2019 of headwaters and gaining surface waters. The course is structured to focus on different types of systems separately, e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and estuaries while demonstrating that many of the same ecological processes and phenomena occur in each, i.e., biogeochemical cycling, controls on primary production, evolutionary selection, community patterns, population dynamics and food web structure. The most visible taxa in aquatic systems will be introduced including algae, plants, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles via laboratory and field work. The course will discuss how drinking, irrigation, recreation, transportation, flood control and power generation compete for water resources, altering the ecology of inlands ecosystems. Case studies will integrate ecological sub-disciplines while highlighting the human-nature conflicts in freshwater systems. Students interested in watershed and marine systems will find the course extremely useful in their understanding of how various biota co-exist in these seemingly simple systems.

In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9\/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?","1609":"This course provides an overview of the growing field of disability studies.

This course will examine the multiple modes by which the body has been understood and imagined, drawing primarily from queer, feminist, disability and critical race scholars. In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze.","1616":"This interdisciplinary course will examine the development of LGBTQ social movements in the US by linking the context, goals, and outcomes of movements to the dynamics of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, ability, immigration status, and geography.

Course is equivalent to LGCS 112 PZ .","1798":"Human languages display an impressively diverse range of grammatical structures, from obvious differences in fundamental patterns of word order to very nuanced distinctions in a wide range of morphosyntactic constructions, such as: agreement patterns, case-marking patterns, morphological representation of the participants in an event, noun classification systems, voice (e.g. active, middle, passive, anti-passive), expression of tense, whether word order is rigid or flexible, and even the expression of sociolinguistic\/discourse phenomena like politeness or reliability of evidence in grammaticalized forms. This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world\u2019s languages.

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello\u2019s Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky\u2019s Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers.

Letter grade only.","1866":"This course provides students with the intellectual framework and critical vocabulary to examine video games as media texts via aesthetics: the value of gameplay experiences and how we fit them into our lives. How do we play, and why? The course will also address questions of politics: how can games shape, and how are they shaped by, the current of public life? Who gets to play, particularly along lines of race, gender, sexuality, and class? Live and recorded gameplay demonstrations will provide students with the material for criticism and inquiry, alongside contemporary critical games writing that will serve as models for their own writing projects.

Through a range of theoretical texts and in conjunction with detailed analysis of select films and media, this course examines and debates the various, competing accounts of depicting, disseminating, and consuming images of violence. How did the omnipresence of scenes of violence on screens become a transnational phenomenon? Why does it have the power to move, excite or titillate us? What is our responsibility to images of violence, if any? These are some of the questions we will address as we chart the history of screening violence from early film and media to the present.

How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema\u2019s bodily representations and the relationship between the viewer\u2019s body and the events on the screen. Our approach is organized around a diverse cross-section of film screenings that include art cinema, experimental cinema, Hollywood melodrama, global cinema, and body horror. Turning attention to what is at stake when we consider what it means to feel cinema permits a wide range of critical approaches to screen media including continental philosophy, media theory, genre theory, experimental cinema, and feminist thought. Throughout the semester, we will become better acquainted with the sensuous facets of cinema along with the social, political, and aesthetic possibilities cinema affords when understood as both appealing to a sensuous body and being a sensuous body in its own right. Letter grade only.","1870":"This course will concentrate on time as a category of analysis. Cinema possesses distinct affinities with the rationalization of labor and standardization of time that took place at the end of the nineteenth century, and yet it also provides a way of negotiating and resisting these processes, as it imagines alternative relations to standardized time. The course begins from the proposition that cinema provided a way for the twentieth century to re-think its changed relation to time after industrial modernity. Topics will include amnesia, boredom, duration, distraction, memory, the supposed death of cinema, real time, and simultaneity. Letter grade only. .","1871":"In the humanities, Realism has been criticized for impressing upon audiences the illusion that they are watching real life events unfold spontaneously before their eyes - an illusion that takes on a politically conservative role as a vehicle for the circulation of dominant ideological meanings. In the sciences, by contrast, Realism has attracted far more favorable reviews: for example, Einstein writes that \u201cIf one renounces this assumption [of Realism]\u2026then I do not see what physics is supposed to describe.\u201d In this course we will examine the interplay between these two attitudes towards Realism. In particular we will suggest that it is possible to recuperate a politically progressive role for Realism as an aesthetic-representational form. Letter grade only.

Along the way, we will learn a number of terms and theoretical concepts, including formalism, realism, surrealism, post-colonialism, modernity, postmodernity, and globalization.","1873":"This class draws on the figure of the drone to consider contemporary developments in media theory and practice. It invokes the drone \u2013 understood not just as a weaponized device but as forming part of a distributed, mobile, interactive, information network \u2013 to explore emerging logics of interactivity, data processing and automation. The course will rely upon critical theory to examine the development of asymmetrical power and remote control associated with drones and will situate the drone within the cultural imaginary, drawing upon the historical relationship between military and media technology. The goal will be to use the figure of the drone to illuminate more general logics of cybernetic control \u2013 their fantasies and actualities and the ways in which these relate to historical figures of automata, telepresence and action-at-a-distance. Additionally, the class will explore and critique theoretical developments that anticipate the forms of knowing, sensing and experiencing associated with the figure of the drone.

Letter grade only. .","1875":"This course develops theoretical approaches to the analysis of film as it enters the digital era. The course starts out with classic film theory and concludes with a consideration of the impact of digitization. Along the way we will learn a number of terms, theoretical concepts and methodological approaches to critically evaluate and analyze fictional films, including formalism, realism, genre, ideology, semiotics, structuralism, psychoanalysis and postmodernism. We will consider the question of how forms of analog film fare in the digital era and what is meant by the pronouncement of the \u201cdeath of film.\u201d Letter grade only. .","1876":"This course introduces students to the study of television from an aesthetic, theoretical and critical perspective.

Areas of focus include the following: The Frankfurt School, The Chicago School, Pragmatism, Structuralism and Post-Structuralism, Semiotics, Feminist Theory, Queer Theory, Psychoanalytical Theory, Postcolonial Theory, and Critical Race Theory.","1878":"Serial media is ubiquitous. The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the \u2018binge model\u2019 of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form. Letter grade only.","1879":"The Original Television Series from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d to \u201cMad Men.\u201d. The course examines the original television series, a prominent development in U.S. television and, more broadly, in American culture during the last decade. We discuss representative texts in this genre, among them The Sopranos, The Wire, and Mad Men, and examine the genre\u2019s distinctive features. We also look at how television series engage with American culture.","1880":"This course will critically examine the role of media (including, but not limited to: cinema, television, music, journalism, and video games) in facilitating, disseminating, and challenging social, political, and cultural constructions of \u2018blackness.\u2019 We will analyze the production and consumption of black representations in mainstream American media and explore the ways these processes influence basic assumptions about social roles, expectations, and norms that tend to inhere to concepts of \u2018blackness\u2019 and black popular culture. Students will be encouraged to develop a critical and political consciousness around historical formations of black identity, their own participation in embracing and\/or resisting black representations, and the impact of black popular culture on their lived experiences. The course will be structured as a seminar and will emphasize collaborative thinking and discussion. Each class will feature a media component, a brief lecture putting the assigned media and readings into context, followed by collective discussion and contribution. Letter grade only.","1881":"Of all the film genres that partition and divide the products of American cinema, the horror genre has proven to be the most durable and the most easily adaptable to the shifting historical circumstances and socio-political anxieties to which it runs parallel. This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term \u201chorror,\u201d and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response?

Yet anti-epic and anti-heroes often critique the values woven into traditional epic form. This course surveys the role of epic heroes\/heroines across ancient, medieval, and modern times in order to better understand the changing conceptions of heroes: what kinds of knowledge do epic heroes produce and how does this knowledge relate to our lives? Along with screening films, we read epic poems (e.g., Near Eastern, Greek, Roman, English, German), novels, and critical theory.","2526":"We explore the strange world of Greek tragedy through a reading of selected plays (e.g., Sophocles, Euripides) and modern adaptations (plays and films).

Special emphasis will be placed on the origins and nature of the novel, with a look at Homer's Odyssey and Euripides' romances as well as theorists including Bakhtin.","2529":"From Cleopatra's beguiling charms and Medea's torrid love affair with Jason to Homer's wily Odysseus and Oedipus' complex, ancient culture still provides material for conceptualizing modern political, racial, social, and sexual issues as imagined in modern Hollywood films and European cinema. This course explores the relationship between modernity and antiquity through a study of cinematic adaptations of mythical narratives; central to these discussions are the relationship between aesthetics and politics and the shifting role of culture from common ground to culture industry and beyond. In addition to screening films, students will also read plays, poetry, historical narratives, film criticism, and works of critical theory.","2530":"The ancient Greeks and Romans categorized sexuality differently from modern Westerners. This course focuses on same-sex love, an area of maximal difference. Using ancient evidence\u2014from literature, history, and art\u2014as well as modern theories, we will study the history of sexuality in the Classical cultures.","2531":"Using evidence from literature, oratory, law, medical writings, and the visual arts, this course will explore the legal and social position of women in ancient Greece; male attitudes toward women and the idea of the Female; sexuality; and the contrast between the myths of powerful women and the apparent reality.","2532":"This class surveys some of the prominent myths of the ancient Greek and Roman world, with attention to material culture, literary interpretation, theory of myth and modern reception. How did Greeks and Romans live among their myths? The class is usually taught jointly by a literary Classicist and an archaeologist. Readings include selections from Hesiod, Homer, the dramatists, Ovid and Apuleius.","2533":"From the Augustan Age onward, the Roman World was sharply divided between a self-created image of order, stability, and propriety, based on Rome's visible political and military achievements, and its increasing involvement with exotic, private, and unconscious forces of disruption and decay. This course will examine closely those so-called \"enemies of Roman order\": religious cults, superstition, personal corruption and excess, popular violence, the Roman obsession with death, the radical decline from Classical models of life and art.

Yet despite it being something many of us seek, we do not all agree on what is true. This course examines some methods that are seen as offering access to universal truth, while also proposing additional ways of knowing that challenge such claims. Who decides what is true and false? What do we do when dominant powers insist on a version of truth that we do not believe? Is there such a thing as truth, and, if not, what does it mean for something to be a lie? In addressing these questions, we consider how institutions, socially constructed categories such as race and gender, and other cultural frameworks influence ways of evaluating truth.","2539":"Given the fact that, in 2018, nearly seven million Americans were subject to some form of \"correctional supervision,\" and over two million Americans were incarcerated, we might think that there must be very compelling answers to the question that serves as this course's title; and while most of us will agree that particular impositions of punishment are unjust, few of us are likely to dispute the justification of the institution of legal punishment, per se. We aim during the semester to investigate the telling and disorientating relationship between various theories of legal punishment and the realities of legal punishment. We begin with an investigation of a number of influential justifications of punishment and then turn to various accounts and analyses of the shape legal punishment takes in contemporary America. Coursework includes attending writing workshops at the local women's prison on several Tuesday evenings. Students must be available on Tuesdays, 4:30-8:30 p.m.","2540":"Forced displacement, migration, and resettlement, caused and influenced by several global, contextual, intra- and inter-personal sociocultural realities, enact dynamic and multilevel life changes for individuals affected by such situations. Contexts of oppression and discrimination incite violence, genocide, and pervasive loss that in turn influence the well-being and lived experience of those made to endure such conditions. Trauma endured as a function of forced displacement and migration, however, does not end at the point of resettlement as individuals are then made to endure new contexts that are also often fraught with discrimination, economic difficulty, and other substantial life changes. This class will adopt an inter disciplinary approach to understand the global history of forced displacement, migration, and resettlement to better conceptualize present realities for individuals made to endure these conditions. As such, we will also turn attention to present realities of resettlement in our own surrounding area.","2541":"Recommended for those students with no previous dance experience.

We'll investigate how women negotiated these conventions within conversion narratives, captivity narratives, novels, autobiography, and essays. We'll learn about the methodologies and theoretical frameworks literary scholars use think intersectionally about how gender and power operate in these texts.

The backlash against globalization has taken many forms, from the rise of nationalist populism and its anti-immigrant, anti-European Union sentiments on the far-right, to protest movements such as \"Nuit-Debout\" on the far-left. To understand these developments, we will explore: recent industrial dislocations; immigration in the postwar period; the legacy of French colonialism; Islam in France; the \"banlieues\" as a site of contestation; the recent refugee crisis; Charlie-Hebdo and other recent terrorist attacks and their aftermaths.

Readings will include Diderot, Gouges, Rousseau, Voltaire, and a range of current texts, from press articles to scholarly essays.","2671":"Nonfiction cinema does not simply represent our historical world. It makes claims about it. It engages with reality. And like many other forms of art, it aspires to transform reality by changing the way we see it. Using French and Francophone films as examples, this course will explore the diversity of ways in which, since its inception in 1895 and the Lumiere brothers' 50 second films, \"Le Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el\" has not ceased to reinvent itself, becoming today one of the most protean forms of cultural intervention. Taught in French.","2672":"Display, Desire and Domination (\"Se Faire Connaitre en Image\") allows students to study and analyze imagery from Francophone contexts related to groups traditionally targeted for their gender, sexuality, race and class.

Underpinning the construction of feminine identity central to each of the texts will be a charting of the evolution of French fiction.","2677":"French mystery novels are steeped in crime, grime, and wine. And they abound in evocative detective figures. Some of these sleuths, such as Vidocq (1809), are felons turned policemen while others, such as Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (1905), are themselves masters of the caper. Maigret from the 1930s emerged as the compassionate lawman of the people, Nestor Burma from the 1950s as the ultimate hard-boiled private detective whereas Commissaire Adamsberg, from the 1990s, is the puzzle-solving dreamer.

We will not concentrate on film history, but rather on how cinema has portrayed history over the years. For this reason, the course will not explore well known masterpieces of Italian cinema, but we will instead analyze the impact of less known productions, films made for television or films that were not destined to foreign distribution, in order to analyze how Italian history has been translated into the popular imaginary. The course will be taught entirely in Italian. Meets Letters and Foreign Language general education requirements.","2812":"This course offers an introduction to Boccaccio's Decameron, one of the masterpieces of Italian literature, through a close reading of Boccaccio's collection of hundred tales, an investigation of the literary traditions (tradizioni) that converge in the most important prose work of the Italian Middle Ages, and its cinematic \"translations\" (traduzioni\/tradimenti). During the semester, we will read all the novellas that have been adapted for the screen by Pier Paolo Pasolini (Decameron, 1971), and the Taviani brothers (Magnifico Boccaccio, 2015) identifying the challenges that such a classical Italian work presents to Italian filmmakers in their attempts to transcribe it into an audiovisual spectacle. By reading and analyzing a large selection of Boccaccio's one hundred novelle, and watching and examining their corresponding filmic transpositions, we will address notions and problems of language, style, structure and content for each novella, together with the techniques of transposition of the written text to the movie screen.","2813":"The year 2020 marks the two hundredth anniversary of Pellegrino Artusi's birth, author of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), the most prominent and famous Italian cookbook in the history of gastronomy. However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen. Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining \"Italianess\", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.","2814":"Specific course information available in pre-registration materials.","2815":"Students will learn the basics of Latin grammar and syntax along with some aspects of ancient Roman culture and literature.

A basic familiarity with liberal political philosophy, while helpful, is not required.","2962":"While civil liberties protect the individual from coercive power by outlining what the government must not do, civil rights protect the individual from coercive power by obligating the government to take positive action. This course examines civil liberties and civil rights in American public law and jurisprudence.","2963":"This course examines the competing claims of \"legalism\" (with its emphasis on formal rules and neutral principles) and \"legal storytelling\" (which prioritizes subjective experiences of the law as actually practiced) regarding questions of race, gender, and justice in American constitutional law. Through close readings of both literary and legal texts, the course adopts a humanistic approach to legal scholarship, locating the force of law within its discursive and rhetorical dimensions. Topics to be discussed include: rights to privacy, sexuality and reproductive freedom; sexual harassment and racist speech; anti-discrimination, integration, and affirmative action.","2964":"This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.","2965":"Given the Black dispersal throughout the world, Africana Political Theory will analyze the intersection of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the formation of political structures through the African Diaspora.

Readings are exclusively and intentionally from the voices of African American\/Black women.","2973":"How do social movements change the world by changing ideas, identities, and norms about the public good? How do they introduce new actors and forms of activism into the political sphere? How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail? This class explores these questions in comparative context, through cases spanning the Christian Right and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in the United States, Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Syria, religious and gendered activism in Saudi Arabia, Palestinian militants, and transnational human rights networks.

This course reflects upon the premises and promises of interculturality through an analysis of literature, testimonies and films by mestizo and indigenous authors from the Andean region. We critically engage in discussions around prevalent ideologies of mestizaje and bilingualism, as well as address the politics of relations among cultures historically in dispute. Philosophies of translation will be key for the analysis of how these cultures related and struggle to coexist.","3091":"The relation between writing, painting, photography and cinema might at first be viewed as a simple and familiar combination of visual and verbal art as felicitous interplay based on affinity and compatibility. However, it also generates numerous theoretical speculations with far-reaching implications for the theorization of art and literature. The potentially frictional relations between the visual image and the written text are especially pertinent for a discussion of the artworks of many Latin American and Spanish artists and writers.","3092":"Special topics for most advanced students. To be arranged with faculty. Offered annually.","3093":"This course is an intensive workshop\/seminar designed to enhance students' rhetorical skills.

Repeatable for credit with different topics.","3094":"We'll investigate the rhetoric of arguments regarding current challenges for the liberal-arts curriculum, asking questions such as: What are the traditional liberal arts, and how are they being re-defined today in response to larger shifts in the culture? Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions.

The second section of the course looks at the perils of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, which have been the bases of humanity\u2019s startling new relationship to energy and energy consumption beginning in the early 1800s; it also asks whether shifting from these energy sources to energy sources that are sustainable and humane will require shifting to a non-growth (i.e., a non-capitalist) economy. And too, this section of the course challenges students to investigate how each College in the consortium is a \u201ccomplicit institution\u201d in the current inhumane energy regime. For the final section of the course, students must carefully plan and initiate an activist intervention that addresses and redresses the perils of fossil fuels and\/or nuclear energy.

The course examines the ways in which women scholars and activists over the past four decades have engaged in intellectual, political, and cultural work, that has transformed and continues to transform scholarly theory and activism.","3154":"Understanding of the indigenous cultures in the Americas have been shaped profoundly by cinematic images. Representations of and by Native Americans have much to say not only about the people they depicture but also about the complex relationships between them and national societies. This class studies a selection of iconic films: including ethnographies, mainstream narrative films, as well as the work of indigenous film and videomakers. Our focus will be on understanding the constructed nature of these cultural artifacts as they become important elements in the production of history and historical agents. This course considers that what is put into images is as important as what is left out.","3155":"While digital media seem ubiquitous and are indeed a global phenomenon, digital media are culturally situated, meaning people in different cultures think of them and use them in different ways. We will discuss examples from around the world in order to explore digital media from an anthropological perspective. This class will explore questions such as: Are our digital devices really changing the way we connect and interact with our social worlds? Are these digital media replacing \u201canalog\u201d print, film, or face-to-face communications?

The remainder of the course will follow the development of the relationships between Indigenous peoples and Tribal Nations and members of the settler colonial citizenry, and local, state, federal and international governments and organizations with respect to the protection of sacred places, and cultural and environmental resources.","3357":"This course will provide an interactive, in-depth assessment of the legal, social and political conditions that have allowed California to grow into a world-leading environmental management powerhouse while at the same time being confronted with decades-long environmental challenges that continue to impact the public health and impede economic growth. These issues will be examined in the context of local and statewide efforts underway right now to protect and improve the environment and will establish a foundation for students looking to understand how and where they can effectively participate in the political process.","3358":"This course examines the southern california landscape through a series of environmental case studies. Each week, we will examine one regional environmental issue, and how that issue is framed and addressed by governments, local communities, industry, and other stakeholders. As the semester goes on, we will discover numerous relationships among these disparate problems, and their implications for human health, nature, infrastructure, politics, and the economy.","3359":"This course introduces domestic environmental policy (including energy policy) and how it is established, developed and implemented in the United States. In this course, we will explore the historical context of how governmental structure has profound effects on the establishment of national and state environmental policy. We will discuss challenges, successes and obstacles of past environmental policy decisions and look at the future to determine how citizens, scientists and policy makers will continue to deal with how humans affect their environment.","3360":"How is U.S. environmental policy formulated and how does it relate to social, historic, and political dynamics? This course argues that the \u201cstandard model\u201d of direct provision of government services has been substantially unraveling due to a series of new trends in policy including: greater public involvement, devolution, and dispersion.","3361":"This course critically engages water politics and policy in the arid Southwestern United States, with a focus on California. The class will examine the role of multiple stakeholders in the state including: agribusiness which needs water to grow crops, cities which need water for people, lawns, and industry, and fish and other species which need water to survive.","3362":"Urban ecology is a subfield of ecology that deals with the interaction between humans and the environment in urban settings. This course brings together concepts and research from diverse fields to explore themes of environment and cityscape, relationships between industrialization, green space, and health, ecological challenges in rapidly urbanizing areas, and global social movements toward sustainable cities. A key objective of the course is to consider urban environments through their dynamic relationships to social, political, and economic systems with a key focus on globalization and public life.","3363":"Design Workshop explores design innovation inspired by our relationships with nature. In particular, the course revolves around diverse design concepts and creations expressive of a sense of place. Through explorations of scholarly, artistic, and GIS explications of place, our individual and interpersonal relationships with Nature and with one another explored as strategies for creating sustainable communities. This is a studio course, extending the notion of \u2018studio\u2019 beyond the walls of the built environment. Studio practice is emphasized through plein air graphic arts, natural history observations, field sketches and recordings, creative expansions of geographic information systems (GIS), community design, and other practice-based skills. We depend on being rooted in an actual place for our sense of who we are and what we can do. Yet in this age of globalization, what happens to the distinctive character of places? In the face of unprecedented mobility, technology, and alienation, what connections to places do we have and can we hope to nurture?","3364":"The interdisciplinary field of Natural History links the natural sciences to the humanities and social sciences by combining ecological field studies with drawing and painting, cultural history, and social analysis. This course introduces students to the complicated history of natural history and the rich botanical and wildlife studies that naturalists have completed, while having students actively doing natural history themselves at the Pitzer Arboretum and Bernard Field Station. One Saturday field trip is required.","3365":"Qualitative Research Methods is a pre-requisite for the EA senior thesis course. We learn ethics and methods surrounding qualitative fieldwork, study research design, and develop a toolkit tailored to environmental analysis. The course is geared toward helping students jump start their senior theses projects, and is designed to take students through the Institutional Review Board approvals as well as writing literature reviews and proposals related to their topics. Suggested for senior students who plan to take EA thesis course in Spring.","3366":"This course will introduce students to the rise of global environmental governance, examine specific environmental issues and international treaties (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and Kyoto Protocol), analyze the politics around the international policy process, and explore how global environmental governance intersects with geopolitics, conflict and national security.","3367":"Creating parks and conservation areas is one major way that governments and nongovernmental organizations attempt to protect endangered species and biodiversity. In this class we will examine a variety of protected areas, conflicts around these areas, and programs designed to reduce these conflicts. We will use the Bernard Field Station as a central case study. This course includes a social responsibility component.","3368":"Design Process Studio centers on the analytical, (re)generative, (re)creative, and sensory pursuit of reading the landscape to develop a multidisciplinary design process for making","3369":"In this course, we will consider how democratizing planning and design could be used to dismantle unjust systems and ensure a sustainable future. We will examine undemocratic planning through social history and its connection to structural racism. We will learn what is the people\u2019s \u201cright to the city\u201d, why democratizing planning is important, how planners and community members can shift planning practice and facilitate a \u201cJust Transition,\u201d and how to use popular education tools and strategies to \u201cbuild the new\u201d planning paradigm. We will study theoretical frameworks and practitioner principles for democratizing and decolonizing planning practice and how to apply participatory methodology in everyday planning practice.","3370":"A critical survey of project and integrative systems-based sustainability initiatives. Applying performance\/outcome perspectives, students analyze and (re)present adaptive, transformative and catalytic roles played by design, planning, engineering, conservation, science, technology, policy, cultural formation, participation, and media in making sustainable and resilient places, practices, and settings.","3371":"This studio course will engage students In the integrative practices of design and planning toward the creation of a sustainable and resilient place. Critical analyses will be paired with projective approaches to (re)shape and adapt space in a built and planted project in redefined ecological, cultural, policy, and technological settings.","3372":"Based on a social constructivist perspective, the course addresses theoretical frameworks and methods used to interpret a cultural group\u2019s definition of and relationship to nature and the environment. Emphasis is placed on \u2018new\u2019 creative, interactive, and participatory methods of geographical research, which, along with interviews, are used to elicit detailed pictures of places as people experience them, producing data and insights that can be applied in place-making, community-based planning, public participation GIS, and place-based conservation planning and management. Students will complete a project designed to provide grassroots input into a specific environmental planning process.","3373":"An interdisciplinary investigation of the desert environment as a place with some emphasis on Australia and the American Southwest. Correlations between natural and cultural forms, histories, materials, motives, and adaptations will be studied. Topics to be considered will include structural and behavioral adaptations in the natural and cultural ecologies; climate, geomorphology and architectural form; taxonomy, desert flora and fauna and their cultural uses; and various ramifications of the interaction between the desert ecology and cultural consciousness in arid zones. Enrollment is limited.","3374":"This class is concerned with the state of tribal peoples and ethnic minorities around the world. Particular attention is given to environmental problems and their effects on diverse peoples. We explore case studies of the cultural and environmental consequences of rainforest destruction, tourism, energy development, national parks, and war. We critique programs to assist oppressed peoples and the environments that sustain them. Participants are asked to choose a geographical, cultural, and topical area and make recommendations particular to the problems and the needs of that region.","3375":"Our relationship with the world is impacted by the images we use to understand and express our place in nature. This course engages investigation and application of ecological concepts and how these are addressed through art. We experiment with conceptual approaches to art making and strategies for how artists can create positive visions for the future. In this combined theory & praxis course, we integrate studio art with scholarly analysis and engaged field research as we create socially and environmentally responsible artworks. The focus for fall 2019 is the completion of a Field Guide to the Claremont Wilderness Park; students with experience with graphic design, illustration, and natural history are particularly encouraged to enroll.","3376":"This course will examine the primary literature and incorporate lectures from specialists from Southern California to explore theories, patterns, and predictive methods relating to the ecology of Southern California ecosystems. This course will include trips and hands-on activities at the Bernard Field Station and Redford Conservancy, a nearby chaparral system and the Nature Lab at the LA County Natural History Museum. The focus of this course is to become well acquainted with the local biota, how different ecosystems function in Southern California, and be able apply what was learned to the effective management of regional biota and resources.","3377":"Students are trained in principles of environmental education, and serve as instructors to children from elementary schools in Pomona and Claremont. Participants work in teams to develop and teach effective environmental curricula at the Bernard Biological Field Station. In addition to teaching environmental ethics, local ecology, and critical ecological concerns, course participants serve as role models of environmental sensibility and community involvement. Enrollment is provisional until after the first class meeting when course applications are distributed.","3378":"This course reviews key theories and methods to prepare sophomore and junior EA majors for senior-level work. This advanced seminar will facilitate your transition from being Environmental Analysis students to Environmental Analysis scholars who are prepared to conduct original research and\/or engage with hands-on research and writing. We will read and discuss EA-based research with particular attention to the different methodological and theoretical approaches used in the field. The course is organized based on the most common types of evidence Environmental Analysis scholars use in their research. Each week we will examine articles that use different types of evidence, including: archival documents; law and legislation; newspapers and magazines; photography; film; music; oral history, ethnography, and interviews; maps, spatial data, demographic data, and reports; and museum exhibitions, public history and memorials. We will also read a number of articles to better understand the ongoing debates over how \u201cEnvironmental Studies\u201d should be defined. Through readings and class discussions, as well as writing assignments, students will develop the analytical tools they need to begin their upper-level work in EA. Sophomore and Junior EA students are invited to participate.","3379":"A seminar examination of how environmental issues are portrayed in the news media. Specific issues will be determined by the current news, but general concerns include representation of the environment, habitat destruction, consumerism, development, environmental justice, politics and the environment, local and global topics, media bias, and environmental perception. Senior EA majors only.","3380":"mbedded in the fabric of the built and planted environments of higher education. Planned and designed places of learning in North America represent a historical record from the 17th century forward. The primary focus of this course, the conservation of Pitzer\u2019s mid-century California Modern campus, provides a specific setting and narrative in this important history as it also addresses issues of evaluation and conservation for the century ahead.","3381":"We examine how ideas about nature and the environment and the human-nature relationship have been explored in film. From wildlife documentaries, to popular dramas of environmental struggles, to cult classics and Disney\u2019s animated visions of nature, the human-nature relationship has been depicted through film to transmit particular views of the world, especially certain constructs concerning gender, race and ethnicity. We view and study films, read relevant theory, and actively critique ways in which our worldview has been shaped and impacted by cinema. Students write 8 five-page papers during the semester.","3382":"Examines the intersection of theories of environmental degradation, economic development and gender. Social theories to be examined include: modernization theory, dependency and world systems, women in development vs. women and development, cultural ecology, eco-feminism, political ecology and feminist political ecology, gender and the environment, and population.","3383":"Resource Depletion and Ghost Towns: The Built Environment and Natural Resources. This course examines the relationship between the built environment, natural resources, and sustainability in the demise of settlements. We begin with an overview of debates surrounding the role of natural resources in the development and decline of towns and cities. We will also look at \u201csustainability success stories,\u201d such as Curitiba. To what extent can natural resource use depletion be blamed for the creation of spaces called \u201cghost towns\u201d? This course includes three required field trips: one day-long field trip, one two-day, and one three-day.","3384":"Creating sustainable urban systems one of the 21st Century\u2019s most crucial challenges. Green urbanism reassesses traditional notions about the interrelationship between the built and natural environments and focuses on catalytic interventions to create sustainable neighborhoods, districts, and regions. The course combines a survey of sustainable design and planning tools- urban ecology, biophilia, biomimicry, green building, the LEED rating system, eco districts, integrated infrastructure, and sustainable city indicators- with creating a proposal to apply the tools to a specific location.","3385":"In this advanced seminar on Environmental Justice, students will directly engage with research questions around the production of space and injustice to the Inland Empire of southern California, and the movements of resistance to combat varying unjust outcomes.","3386":"The EA Senior Thesis Seminar is required for all Pitzer EA majors writing a thesis and is open to any seniors (regardless of campus) who are writing an EA thesis. In the early weeks of the term students will refine and outline their topics. They then devote the remainder of the term to researching primary sources on which their thesis is be based and exploring the secondary literature on their topic. By week 11, students will submit a complete first draft of their thesis. The completed thesis, which typically runs between 40-60 pages (plus notes), is submitted in April. As students work on their own essay, they also serve as peer editors for their classmates. Students sometimes work individually with their advisors, sometimes with their advisor and their peer editor, and sometimes with their entire seminar group","3387":"Someone once said that writing about art is like dancing about architecture. In this seminar we explore what it means to engage with a work of art through writing. How is the practice of the art writer the critic, curator, or historian in conversation with the work of the artist? What can writing bring to art? Do difficult artworks require the art writer to explain them? How can writing about art be a creative practice as well as a scholarly one? In addition to researching, writing, and talking about art, we will also visit exhibitions and interact with artists and writers. Writing projects and assignments range from the conventional to the experimental.","3388":"What is The Point? The Opening of the American Mind A decade ago, a group of students at the University of Chicago founded The Point, a new journal dedicated to robust and open conversation about contemporary political and social theory. Since then The Point has proved a remarkable guide to the at times unsettling dynamics that underlie everyday life in America. It provides perhaps the best collective account of the political meaning of The Teens the decade of both Barack Obama and Donald Trump and offers vibrant ways to understand our political present. With all this in mind, the course considers possible futures for our world through the lenses of the wide range of intellectuals who have written for The Point.","3389":"The Ancient World - Past, Presents, Futures The ancient Mediterranean famous as the home of the Greeks and Romans was inhabited by millions of people who spoke hundreds of languages and worshipped countless gods. This course not only explores this world on its own terms, but also considers how ancient Mediterranean cultures have been reconstructed and interpreted ever since. We will explore how ideas about the past have shaped the present, including conceptions of race, slavery, and colonialism and the notion of the West. We will look at filters through which we see the ancient world, ranging from the Greeks and Romans themselves to Islamic scholars, medieval kings, the writers of the US constitution, several dictators, modern artists, and Hollywood filmmakers (among others).","3390":"Tongue-in-cheek: Humor in Arts and Visual Culture In this course you will develop your skills as a writer\/critical thinker while examining the topic of humor. Humor is an incredibly important vehicle for dealing with complex questions and one of the few forms that allows an author to communicate contradictory statements simultaneously. Humor has the ability to make something inaccessible, accessible or open up a taboo subject for discussion. In some cases humor is a political gesture. In this course we will examine humor through a critical interdisciplinary and intercultural lens. You will be responsible for developing written responses, critiques, oral presentations, performative projects, art and research.","3391":"People on the Move: Understanding U.S. Immigration The United States is often described as a nation of immigrants, yet immigration has long been a vexed issue. If you follow the news, immigration is often mired in a crisis. DACA! Unaccompanied minors! Migrant families! Illegal aliens! Refugees! This class will help you make sense of U.S. immigration news. You will gain a foundation in the laws, policies, and history of U.S. immigration. You will learn about the different pathways that people use to immigrate to the U.S. The class will also consider the humanitarian and ethical.","3392":"One of the most puzzling of psychological phenomena is the nature of dreams. Are they window into the unconscious mind or just random neural activity during sleep? Dreams are a subjective and private experience. For the dreamer, dreams can be fantastic and illogical, filled with images of ones life often colored with strong emotions and feelings. We will examine whether the meaning and nature of dreams can be explained and understood according the principles of science and rational thought. Lectures, readings and class discussions will explore a number of different perspectives on the nature of dreams and dreaming. We will also look at how dreams are represented in our society through art, music and film and whether or not dream states can be artificially induced through drugs or brain machine interfaces.","3393":"The Last Laugh: Gender and Stand-up Comedy In this seminar well look at how stand-up comedians use their routines to present different views about gender. We will use tools from linguistics to examine not only what these performers say but also how they say it. What messages are comedians sending about masculinity and femininity? How do women of color challenge stereotypes with their performances? What do queer comedians add to the conversation? We will also look at the pluses and minuses of studying the media using quantitative versus qualitative methods.","3394":"Speculative Feminisms and Sustainable Futures The future is female, proclaims a well-worn feminist adage. Emerging from a circle of radical lesbian intellectuals in 1970s New York City, the statement operates simultaneously as incantation and prediction, synthesizing the voices of all who utter it into something generative, rather than simply descriptive. Yet, it reverberates somewhat dissonantly in our contemporary moment; even the term female can evoke the same essentializing tendencies that queer and intersectional feminisms today actively unsettle. Drawing on a range of recent fictional, critical, and localized knowledges, this seminar invites additional speculative futures, exploring interdisciplinary thinking and writing as generative practices.","3395":"From Climate Change to Vaccines to Frankenfood we are bombarded in our daily lives with scientific (and pseudoscientific) information. How do people use this information. Why do some accept the science on evolution but not vaccines? Or on climate change but not GMOs? The goal of this seminar is to explore how we use science in our daily lives. We will focus on three central questions: How is scientific knowledge generated? How do people assess and assimilate scientific information in their of daily decision making? How accurately are scientific controversies presented in the media? No prior science experience necessary.","3396":"There are many aspects that comprise our social identity - age, gender, race\/ethnicity, school affiliation, religion, the list goes on and on. According to psychologists, these social identities shape the way we navigate our world, such as how we categorize ourselves and others, and who we tend to compare ourselves to. Social identity informs us of who constitutes our ingroup and who constitutes the outgroup with implications for stereotyping and intergroup prejudice. In this course, we will examine how social identities shape our perception of the world and the consequences for affect, cognition, and behavior.","3397":"Environmental Documentaries: Social Justice and the Environment This course introduces students to current national and international environmental and social justice issues by exploring how they are documented in film. We examine these documentaries not just as a way of exploring environmental problems but also as vehicles for understanding how arguments are made, how audiences are persuaded, and how evidence is used to justify various theses and assertions. This year the main themes in this course will be climate change; petroleum exploitation and its environmental and social impacts; human encroachment on disappearing habitat; and perspectives on wildlife.","3398":"Pandemic Histories: Europe During and After the Black Death In 1347, the Black Death reached Mediterranean Europe and, within a few years, killed over half of Europes population. What were important impacts of the pandemic? How did people respond to the experience? By 1351, Giovanni Boccaccio had written a wildly popular fictional work the Decameron (Ten Days) - in which 10 young women and men shelter in the countryside and pass the time by telling stories filled with humor, sex, violence, deceit, virtue, or pathos. To explore the pandemics impacts, well read the Decameron in conjunction with historical investigations of the Black Deaths social and cultural consequences.","3399":"Writing about music can illuminate philosophical questions about the arts, the mind, and aesthetic experience: What defines music - and musicality? How is music biologically grounded and yet also culturally and historically contingent? What are the relationships between music and language, emotion, and movement? This interdisciplinary seminar will also explore how scholars across the humanities, social and behavioral sciences, and natural sciences approach the phenomena they wish to explain. Students will practice developing well-reasoned arguments and defending them with appropriate evidence. Through the microcosm of music, we will seek to become analytical readers, elegant writers, clear speakers, and generous listeners.","3400":"\u201cFacts and Evidence Don\u2019t Work Here\u201d: Anti(Racism) and Emotion In this course, we will explore how emotion impacts how and why people participate in racism and engage in anti-racism in the United States through an interdisciplinary lens. In doing so, students will reflect upon their own positionality, to contextualize their own experiences in U.S. society, begin to see how all our fates are linked. Students will engage in their learning in a variety of ways including in-class writing, research papers, and peer-review and student presentations.","3401":"This course examines changes in the environment through multiple lenses of land and landscape and the broad bandwidth of writing about the earth. As half of the terrestrial earth has been transformed for human purposes, landscape has become a diversely composite index of human life, a complex inscription on the earth of civilization\ufffds values. Students will be encouraged to find their own land and landscape voices as they are also exposed to the ways in which others have written about their inquiries into the everyday and extraordinary relationship we have the realm of earthly life.","3402":"How did immigration and the U.S. - Mexico border transform from a low - priority policy issue into one of the most contentious issues in the 20th Century? One of the most important factors shaping the size and composition of authorized and unauthorized immigration is U.S. immigration policy. Indeed, to meet labor demands, U.S. immigration policy initially encouraged immigration from Mexico and other parts of the globe. Although labor demands continued, by the latter part of the 20th Century, some elites saw a political opportunity by constructing immigrants as a threat and the U.S. Mexico border as dangerous. A major focus of this course examines the process that has led to the criminalization of immigrants and the militarization of the U.S. Mexico border.","3403":"Associated in the popular imagination with Britain and its former colonies and sometimes baffling to Americans, the 2019 Cricket World Cup was watched by an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide. This course will introduce students to important psychological concepts in sports psychology and apply those concepts to cricket. We will explore the sociohistorical evolution of international cricket. Second, students will be introduced to various intra and interpersonal psychological processes related to sport.","3404":"This seminar will explore the role of la familia (the family) for Latinx people living in the U.S. We will analyze both commonalities and differences across conceptions and constructions of la familia. We will also examine la familia from a comparative perspective (contemporary, across different Latinx groups, within families, across immigration status, etc.), and will consider the psychological, sociocultural, and political factors that contribute to the complexity and diversity of Latinx families. Students will read research and narrative accounts of the journeys that Latinx families have undertaken (in some cases, crossing the U.S.\/Mexico border and being separated from family members) resulting in the development of transnational ties and evolving identities.","3405":"We are in the midst of a global crisis of care. The growing inequalities produced by late capitalism have disrupted our social capacities for everything from birthing and raising children to caring for friends and family to maintaining households and communities. And yet such reproductive labor is essential for the creation and maintenance of social bonds and the functioning of institutions and infrastructures. How are artists and activists pushing back against this crisis, forging collective movements that view care for ones self and ones community as moral imperatives to act? How might the expression of radical care - in literature, activism, and art - call into being more socially just relations among friends, family, neighborhoods, and communities?","3406":"This course\u2019s main goal is for students to learn how to stay well informed about news in the world in which they live. That will involve both using various sources to follow the news and examining the history and shifting political economy of journalism, particularly in the context of the internet. A core assignment will be to read each days New York Times online, but this will be supplemented by a range of local, national, and global news sources, as well as relevant scholarly literature.","3407":"What do different thinkers believe the future will bring, and what is basis of those predictions? We will assess social science research, fiction, and one or more movies about such topics as the future of work, economic inequality, education, moral decision making, state surveillance, the climate, and social effects of technological change. In addition to sharpening your writing, research, and critical analysis skills, the course will introduce you to disciplinary differences in research and writing as we compare articles by philosophers, anthropologists, economists, historians, and cultural critics, among others.","3408":"Drug Development, Policy and Innovation This seminar provides students with an in-depth perspective into the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the process by which a drug candidate transitions from the laboratory to patient. Discussions will also focus on public policy and ethical debates surrounding the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of science. Topics include: the link between academic research and industry, the clinical trial process by which a molecule becomes a drug, the origin and role of the FDA in protecting the consumer, the concept of informed consent in ethical drug development, and the economics associated with orphan drug development.","3409":"Graphic narratives have long been historical artifacts, from Lascaux cave paintings to the Bayeux Tapestry, demonstrating that illustrative storytelling has been a human activity for millennia. From the 1970s onward,what is now generally called a graphic novel has continued to develop; film, television, and theatrical versions have sprung from what are still often referred to as comic books. Yet the serious subject matter of this output has become an active and important part of visual art and commentary, as seen in Safe Area Gora\u017ede by Joe Sacco, Unterzakhan by Leela Corman, and Drawings from the Gulag by Danzig Baldaev. In this course students will examine, explore, and articulate their ideas through both text and imagery that addresses serious contemporary and\/or historical subjects. Assigned readings and research will be accompanied by substantial drawing and illustration training.","3410":"This course will examine questions surrounding ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality and consider how this diversity has been challenged or accepted in the United States. Students will analyze contemporary and historical issues and explore questions of social justice as they read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts. In discussions and compositions, students will consider the ways that culture and social structures shape the Pitzer experience, as well as imagining their own roles in transforming society. This course is the designated First-Year Seminar for students in the International Scholars Program and is open to non-native English speakers only.","3411":"Designed for students with no previous experience in the language. Students will develop their ability to communicate in spoken and written French in an immersion-style setting. To that end, the course is conducted entirely in French from the first day of class. Our study of social and cultural practices throughout the Francophone world will allow for a deeper understanding of the history and contemporary use of French languages and of what it means to be a French speaker in the world today.","3412":"FREN 002 is the second of two elementary-level courses designed to prepare students for intermediate-level French. Most students enrolled in FREN 002 come directly from FREN 001; however, sometimes students who have not taken FREN 001 at Pitzer Colllege enroll in FREN 002. At the start of the esemester, your instructor will advise you on the most appropriate course based on your langauge-learning background and proficiency.","3413":"Women and Human Rights Descourse and Practice This seminar will use three windows to look into women\u2019s experiences with the human rights globally, namely: a) ware, liberation movements and struggles as a way to examine how women fare in the political arena; b) food as an example of women\u2019s access and control over basic economic resources in places as far as Asia and Africa, and as close as US inner cities; and c) women and the HIV\/AIDS pandemic in Southern Africa.","3414":"In this course, we will examine the institution of the American family from a sociological perspective. Although we may think of the family as being part of our private lives, it is very influenced by the social forces around us. Students will learn to critically evaluate their assupmtions about family structure and processes, but also critically evaluate social science research presented in the media, research articles, and political arenas.","3415":"This course starts by examining key concepts in debates about Palestine and Israel, notably bias, peoples, participation, and statehood. The course then examines both the history of the crisis and the uses of historical representations to prop up the the current political and social order of Israel and Palestine. In contrast with most received narratives, we find the making of the crisis primarily in the shaping of ethnic conflict and ethno-national state-making by partition under British colonial rule\u2013not in timeless enmities. The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and yet something many Jewish Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo - and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course, we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom - and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Palestine and Israel.","3416":"This course explores the last 500 years of world history. In examining this large expanse of time, the focus is on four closely related themes: (1) struggles between Europeans and colonized peoples, (2) the global formation of capitalist economies and industrialization, (3) the formation of modern states, and (4) the formation of the tastes, disciplines and dispositions of bourgeois society.","3417":"(Formerly HIST22 History of the Discilpines) The social and behavioral sciences-economics, sociology, political science, anthropology and psychology- structure our experience so completely that we sometimes take them for granted. The great division of intellectual labor that these \u201chuman sciences\u201d represent can seem so natural and so logical, that it is sometimes hard to imagine a world without them. But these disciplines did not always exist. In exploring their histories, we simultaneously ask about the contingency of our world and about how it might be different. It is a history of the present.","3418":"For some, environmental history recounts humanity\u2019s long encounter with nature; for others, it is the changing story of the land itself; for still others, it is an account of humanity\u2019s changing ideas about nature and wilderness. In this course we will familiarize ourselves with all of these approaches. The course, which is global in scope, surveys materials from the past five centuries. Major themes include: the history of globalization and industrialization, ecological imperialism, the history of ecology, the idea of wilderness, science and environment and global environmental change.","3419":"The legacies of colonialism in Africa are inscribed on the buildings and landscapes that colonizers left behind. The parks that shelter endangered species today were once the hunting grounds of British and French imperialists; the slave depots of earlier days became the prisons of the modern period. This is in an interdisciplinary, team-taught course that combines the approaches of history and political economy. We will be paying special attention to both \u201cbuilt\u201d and \u201cwild\u201d environments, while bearing in mind that the latter can be just as constructed as the former. We use a number of approaches to compare confinement and conservation across continents: historical case studies, political economic theories, economic development policies, prison architecture, zoo policies, nature films, and safari brochures. We aim to examine present-day landscapes and prison complexes through the comparative lenses of history and political economy.","3420":"This course offers a variety of human histories from the onset of human existence up to 1500ish. Topics include: the distinctiveness of humans as a species, and evidence for this over the course of the late Paleolithic; histories of agriculture, and of major food crops and their movements over time; environmental impacts of diverse human settlements; social inequalities and state formations, and resistance to both; world religious traditions; and cultural differentiation. The course is global in perspective by virtue of (a) its attention to connections (or flows) between dispersed geographic sties, and (b) its use of cross-cultural comparisons. Fundamental to the course is a rejection of the distinction between humans (and human times) without history and humans (and human times) with history.","3421":"To understand Africa as it exists today, one must be able to place current issues within the broader historical trends that have dominated the continent\u2019s past. Accordingly, this course will provide an introduction to the history of modern Sub-Saharan Africa from the build-up to European conquest in the late nineteenth century, through colonization and decolonization to issues facing Africans today. Themes to be explored include: African societies and cultures on the eve of conquest; European imperial ideologies, explorers, and missionaries; African resistance against-and collaboration with-colonial projects; strategies of colonial rule; colonial education; cash-cropping and famine; African workers in colonial cities; gender, sexuality, and family life; health and healing; race, class and citizenship; nationalism and decolonization; post-independence economic crises and \u201cdevelopment\u201d; conflict and globalization.","3422":"This course will provide an introduction to the history of Africa from the build-up to European conquest in the late nineteenth century through decolonization in the twentieth century. Students will explore African experiences of colonization and decolonization though a range of themes and case studies, including: African societies and cultures on the eve of conquest; European imperial ideologies, explorers, and missionaries; African responses to colonial projects; strategies of colonial rule; colonial education; capitalism, cash-cropping, and food production; African workers in colonial cities; gender, sexuality, religion, and family life; race, class, citizenship, and apartheid; development, nationalism, and decolonization.","3423":"An analytical and topical introduction to American history, employing a variety of primary historical sources and secondary monographs. Intended for students who may already have taken U.S. history in high school (including AP history), but have no previous college-level background in history. Among the topics to be considered are the encounters between English settlers and Native Americans, slavery and antislavery, gender relations in the early Republic, the political and social causes of the Civil War, and the events of Reconstruction.","3424":"This course covers Middle Eastern history from the generation or so before the Prophet Muhammad, to the era immediately following the death of Tamerlane (Timur). It is not a history of Islam, although Islam is an important part of the history of this region, and we shall pay most attention to the rise, spread, and cultural flowering of this great civilization.","3425":"The Modern Middle East is one of the most important regions in today\u2019s world. This course begins with the 18th century Middle East and its increasing encounter with the West. We will study the social and political grounds behind the demise of the Ottoman Empire and its consequences for the future development of the region. After exploring how Western expansion and imperialism affected the domestic development of countries in the region, we transition to the Middle East since World War I, examining the emergence of nationalism and nation-states, the origins and future of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the role of ethnic and religious minorities in political affairs. We then analyze the rise of political Islam, the Middle East since 9\/11, and US presence in the region. We will conclude by exploring the recent popular protests in the Arab world and their implications for the fate of the region in the 21st century. Along the way, we ask questions such as these: How did increasing interactions with the West and emerging global trade since the 18th century influence the social and political structures of countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Iran? Why did nationalism and state formation differ from country to country in the region? And finally, what are the historical and intellectual origins of recent waves of popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa?","3426":"West Africa is a region with a rich, fascinating, though often tumultuous history. Legendary medieval empires, Islam, and Christianity, slavery and the slave trade, colonial rule, the formation of nation-states, and crises of war and poverty-these episodes have all shaped the historical experiences of West Africans. Fortunately for those studying West Africa today, this history has been captured with quite extraordinary skill by its novelists and filmmakers. Men and women such as Chinua Achebe, Buchi Emecheta, and Ousmane Sembene have greatly enriched our understanding of the region through their art. This course, therefore, will examine the history of West Africa through novels and films.","3427":"In public discourse the Middle East is often depicted as a homogenous region defined by \u201cIslam\u201d and \u201cArabs,\u201d neglecting the importance of diverse ethnic, religious and other minorities. The aim of this course is to examine the lives, struggles, and achievements of different minorities in the region. We will discuss ideas, conflicts, and treaties that have been shaping interactions between diverse communities since the early 19th century. Along the way we will explore phenomena such as the development and collapse of the Millat System in the Ottoman Empire, the Sunni-Shia divide, and the mounting repression against LGBTQ communities across the region.","3428":"Who are the makers of the Modern Middle East that we know of as such today? Is this region solely a product of Imperialist intervention and authoritarian modernizers like Atat\u00fcrk, Reza Khan, and Gamal Abdel Nasser? In this course we will move beyond the traditional top-down view and investigate the lasting impact of numerous revolutionary movements that transformed societies in the region since the mid nineteenth century. These movements include the Babi Movement (1840s) and Constitutional Revolution (1905) in Iran, the Urabi Revolt (1880s), the 1919 nationalist mobilization in Egypt, and countless student, women, labor, and minority movements ever since.","3429":"For over a century the relationship between the United States and nations of the Middle East was defined by mutual benefit and positive collaboration, especially in the fields of healthcare and education. Whereas the people of the region recognized Europeans as colonial invaders, they viewed America in a very positive light. However, these positive perceptions gave way to a more negative view of the US since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift, we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century.","3430":"Through accounts by merchants, missionaries, explorers, soldiers and captives, this course explores changing relations between European and peoples from the world beyond Europe, from 1200 to 1800. These narratives of encounter reveal evolving European attitudes and ideas about themselves, non-European cultures, civilization, nature and colonization through themes including religion, economy, sexuality, freedom and cannibalism.","3431":"This course explores how scholars have used oral history methodologies to reconstruct the pasts of communities and individuals who are not frequently represented in typical historical sources. The gathering of oral histories-from women, freed slaves, colonized people, gays and lesbians, and other disadvantaged groups-has thus resulted in new understandings of historical processes. Not only will students be introduced to oral history methodologies, but they will also design and conduct oral history projects.","3432":"It is commonplace that history is written by the victors, that the voices of the marginalized are silenced, and that, in the words of Philip Guedalla, \u201cHistory repeats itself. Historians repeat each other.\u201d There have been notable attempts, many notable attempts, to represent the unrepresented. (Howard Zinn\u2019s People\u2019s History being among the most obvious of these.) Too often missing, however, are the sources, and so historians struggle about how to give voice to the voiceless. This course, part of a larger project, aims to build from the bottom up. It is an exercise in self-conscious source creation. Assuming that inmates in the California prison system have things to say- and they do- and that their voices rae under-represented- and they are- we plan to group Pitzer students with inmates. The goal: begin crafting untold narratives together, as a collaborative enterprise.","3433":"As capitalism emerged in Europe (ca. 1150-1600), this controversial idea and the actual accumulation of wealth in communities provoked many responses. This course begins by exploring theories about the development of capitalism. It then examines theological and political debates involving wealth and profit, the social groups who supported or condemned capitalism and cultural responses to inequalities of wealth.","3434":"What was holiness in the pre-modern Mediterranean and Europe? What made someone a saint rather than a heretic or a witch? How did bodies, genders, sexuality, and asexuality shape these roles over time? This course examines changing relationships between sanctity and the body in the Mediterranean and Europe from the waning days of the Roman Empire to 1550 C.E. Through accounts of people either praised as holy or condemned as heretics, we will explore the possibilities of gender roles and gender fluidity, attitudes toward body and love, and the parameters of the medieval third gender.","3435":"This course surveys the history of science as a field, covering the major works, questions and trends that have characterized it over the past half century or so. Subjects we will examine include (but are not limited to) the history of scientific objectivity, Eugenics, the Scientific Revolution, gender and science, science and colonialism, scientific racism, positivism, Islamic science, and the social construction of knowledge. We will sample some seminal primary sources, but the focus will be on the historiography of science\u2013 the stories people have told about science, its importance, its meaning, and its development.","3436":"We shall consider the history of science, from earliest pre-scientific times, to the origins of science in the ancient Greek context, and trace the scientific tradition through the Graeco-Roman period, then through Islamic civilization, discuss social factors, institutions, and larger historical processes that impinged on the practice of science. Factors involved in the translation and transmission of scientific knowledge will be discuessed, both from Greek into Arabic, and from Arabic into Latin.","3437":"The Harlem Renaissance is understood to be a flowering of literature, song, music, poetry, and intellectual thought produced by African-Americans during the decade of 1919-1929. This course will extend the historical needle back to the roots of the Harlem Renaissance - the first Pan-African Conference in 1900 held in London and organized by W.E.B. Du Bois and Anna Julia Copper. Leading figures like these would usher in the world, mood, and tone of the Harlem Renaissance that included a Transatlantic network with African-Americans who had left the United States for Paris to escape the bondage of prejudice.","3438":"Were the Founding Fathers God-fearing Christians or Enlightenment deists? Consequently, should America be a religious or secular nation? The extent to which we inhabit a Christian nation is one of the most ubiquitous (and shrill) debates in contemporary American politics. Central to this debate is the religious (or not-so religious) intentions behind our so-called Founding Fathers, and their plans for our nation\u2019s religious establishment. For some, the Founders were pious and devout men intent on constructing an explicitly Christian nation; for others, they were borderline atheists who envisioned a strict separation of church and state. The historical reality is much more complex than either side readily admits. Burdened by anachronism and oversimplification, this debate is in dire need of thoughtful historical exploration from several angles. This is the work we will perform in this course. We will not only examine and contextualize the complex, conflicting, and often changing views of the Founders themselves, but we will also trace the evolution of this debate from the Revolution to the present. How and why has the struggle over religion in politics taken the form that it has? What, if anything, are the Founders\u2019 relevance for the present?","3439":"This course will trace the development of economic theory from the pre-classical period (mercantilists, cameralists, physiocrats), through the classical school (Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, J. S. Mill), to the critiques of classical political economy (Karl Marx), through the Marginal Revolution (Walras, Menger), to John Maynard Keynes, and beyond (e.g., Milton Friedman). As mush as possible, we will read these works in the context of the spaces and times in which they were conceived. Even as we digest these economic theorists, we will also reflect on larger questions about the historical development of the capitalist system\u2013its preconditions, challenges and constraints.","3440":"Fundamentalism and Rationalism in Comparative Context: Medieval Islam and Enlightenment Europe:","3441":"Despite his lasting importance as a social critic and political thinker, Karl Marx is rarely appreciated as an observer of his own world. In this course, we will read Marx in the context of nineteenth-century Europe. As a working journalist, Marx was intimately familiar with the great movements and upheavals of his time. We follow him from the quiet German towns and idealist philosophy of his youth, to the great revolutionary metropolis of mid-century Paris, to the blaring factories of industrial Manchester and up through the unification of Germany. We will use Marx\u2019s writings to make sense of that world, while, at the same time, attention to the history of nineteenth-century Europe will help us interpret his writings.","3442":"(Formerly HIST172) The construction of gender and sexuality was central to British and French imperialism. This course examines the formation of genders in colonial Asia and Africa from the 18th through the early 20th centuries. We will look at men and women, colonizers and colonized, and hetero- and homosexualities in order to understand the connections between gender, sexuality, race and power. Themes will include gendered discourses that defined political authority and powerlessness; the roles that women\u2019s bodies played in conceptualizing domesticity and desire; and evolving imperial attitudes toward miscegenation, citizenship and rights.","3443":"There are many ways to explore the history of the police state, and this course offers only one of them. Beginning with Michel Foucault, we explore the conceptual foundations of the police state, concentrating especially on its development during the 18th century. From there we move successively eastward in space and forward through time, exploring the subject through histories, novels, diaries, and autobiographical accounts. We are all comfortable with the idea that certain repressive, despotic regimes were (and are) police states. The more uncomfortable question is what the United States shares with places like Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia. It is a complicated question, one with many possible answers; its solution lies in the past.","3444":"\u201cHuman nature\u201d has long been invoked to understand and justify our behaviors. After the advent of Darwinian evolution and Mendel\u2019s gene theory, however, the notion of \u201cinstinct\u201d gained authority, reshaping categories like \u201crace\u201d and \u201cnature.\u201d We will track that shift and examine its effects on political economy and social policy.","3445":"This digital humanities course will examine contemporary African culture and politics from a historical perspective. In collaborative teams, students will create digital archives of Africa\u2019s more recent past, generating and circulating knowledge by curating nontraditional source material, including photography, art, film, video, television, print, televisual and digital advertising, and new media. The aim is to privilege diverse perspectives within civil society. Major themes to be addressed include: colonial and Cold War legacies; race, gender, and sexualities in post-apartheid South Africa; environmental preservation and tourism in East Africa; and the \u201cpost-state\u201d in West Africa in the nee-liberal age.","3446":"Most people associate the word \u201cslavery\u201d with the enslavement and forced migration of African people to the Americas in the early modern era. Though this course does not overlook the momentous nature of this development in world history-and will thus examine it in detail-it also seeks to broaden our knowledge of slavery and slave trading by treating them as worldwide phenomena that date back to the classical age and remain with us still today. Accordingly, this course will consider: the definition of slavery and other forms of servile labor; the institutions and experiences of slavery in diverse historical contexts, especially in Africa and South Asia; why Africans were traded as slaves to the Americas and how this trade affected culture and society in Africa; and, lastly, the continuation of human trafficking in the modern world after the supposed \u201cend of slavery.\u201d","3447":"This course analyzes diverse African experiences, perceptions and geographies of morbidity and mortality from the era of the slave trade, through colonial rule, to recent times. Students will investigate the following major questions: How have death and dying influenced identity and power relations among the living throughout Afric\u2019s past? In what ways were meanings od death and dying connected to the natural world? How did Africans inscribe the natural environment with these meanings, and how did these connections change over time? How have Africans made meaning from human morbidity and mortality through their social, political, economic, and environmental struggles?","3448":"Drawing on diverse historical case studies, life histories, biography, and film, this course examines the broad topic of gender in Africa through such themes as power and gendered rituals of transformation; slavery and the impact of trans-continental slave trades; colonial encounters; European constructions of black female sexuality; changes in African marriage practices and the meaning of marriage; same-sex relationships and homophobia; work, culture, and migrancy; women\u2019s bodies and intimate colonial interventions- medical and moral; ethnicity and nationalism; poverty, famine, and the environment; and the social context of HIV\/AIDS, its spread, and its prevention. The course will also discuss whether the application of western categories of gender is useful for understanding and analyzing the experiences of African men and women.","3449":"This interdisciplinary course examines the historical relationship between humans and the natural environment from a global perspective. We will explore broad themes including early human environmental impacts, the agricultural revolutions, the collapse of early civilizations, health and disease ecology, processes of deforestation and desertification, the transformation in energy regimes, the paradox of population growth, the rise of environmentalism and the conservation movement, and the crisis of modern agriculture and diet.","3450":"Has political violence undertaken against the state or without state permission represented a deviation from (and an obstacle to) American political development, or has it been essential to American political development? Is non-state political violence aberrant or fundamental in American history? This course examines instances of violent dissent and resistance and the way they fit into the established narratives about the American past. The course will also examine the question of legitimacy, asking if Americans have always believed that government has a monopoly on legitimate violence.","3451":"Examination of propaganda past and present. We will look at everything from police state rhetoric to mass-market advertising, investigating the ways in which propaganda has been mobilized in different times and places.","3452":"This course examines the medieval Byzantine and Islamic empires from a comparative perspective (c.300AD to c.1300AD). The history, cultural achievements, and religious contexts of each city will be explored: Constantinople as the imperial center of Byzantine Christianity, and Baghdad as the center of the Abbasid Caliphate. The cities engaged in intense competition (c. 700-1200 AD) for mastery and control of the region an dof the classical Greek legacy. The course concludes with each city\u2019s first major capture and destruction: Constantinople 1204, and Baghdad 1258. Particular attention will be given to the concepts of knowledge and culture as tools of imperialism.","3453":"This course will interrogate the multiple conceptualizations of \u201cdiaspora\u201d through the analytic lens of gender and in a diverse historical contexts, particularly in the early modern and modern eras and focusing on African, Chinese, and Indian diasporas. Until recently, studies have neglected women and gender in comparative diaspora histories. this course will therefore focus on cutting-edge scholarship dealing with identity reproduction, the role of marriage and sex in establishing networks across space and time, and tensions over sexuality, masculinity, patriarchy, community leadership, morality, and belonging.","3454":"In the Spanish Empire, many distinct peoples coexisted under one king and together created a diverse imperial society. This seminar examines the ways that religion, ethnicity, language, law and space defined or failed to define people in the Spanish Empire. We will pay particular attention to the processes of cultural encounter, domination, resistance and adaptation that formed identity. The course begins in Spain, exploring interactions between \u201cold Christian\u201d Spaniards, Jewish people converted to Christianity and Muslims converted to Christianity. We then turn to colonial Latin America and the Philippines to consider interactions between Spaniards and indigenous peoples such as Aztec, Inca, Maya, and Tagalog Filipinos.","3455":"This course examines religious and social transformations in Europe from 1450 to 1640. Focusing on common people\u2019s experiences, we will explore the relationship of religion to social action and tolerance during an era when Latin Christendom broke apart into a religiously divided Europe. We will examine how religious ideas, practices and debates fueled social conflict and protest and under what circumstances religious toleration and intolerance were possible.","3456":"This course examines the history of witchcraft, magic and forbidden versus approved belief in the trans-Atlantic world from 1400 to 1700. We will begin in Europe and then turn to Spanish America and New England to examine the contributions of Africans and Native Americans to both the practice and ideas of witchcraft. Special focus will be given to the role of the devil and the ways that gender influenced decisions to condemn or accept ideas about magic and nature.","3457":"Throughout the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, African-American female intellectuals used their abolitionist tactics of non-violence to reach an international audience. Their goal was to raise awareness about the horrors of Southern slavery, lynching, and practices of Jim Crow. They were invited to speak at international conferences, networked with foreign thinkers, and forged life-long professional alliances with their male counterparts. This course explores the personal letters, journals, poetry, Friendship albums, newspapers, and anti-slavery novels to underscore the critical contributions they made during the era of emancipation. Moreover, how their work helped to frame the paradigm of activism used by the modern civil rights movement leaders of the 1950s and 1960s.","3458":"At the end of the seventeenth century, the bottom dropped out of time. Those accustomed to thinking of the Earth and of humanity, according to biblical timescales now had to confront the possibility of \u201cdeep time,\u201d the possibility of a time whose magnitude defied the imagination. We will examine that shift and its consequences, as it played itself out through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with ramifications into the present.","3459":"We are constantly reminded that we are living through an information revolution - a historically unprecedented transformation, spurred by ceaseless technological change. But ours is not the first \u201cinformation age,\u201d nor is it self-evidently the most revolutionary. This course explores two information revolutions - the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries, and digital communications technologies in the 20th and 21st - to uncover their similarities and differences, and to gain an understanding of the interrelationship between our communbications technologies and our social and political organization.","3460":"This course surveys the history and politics of world soccer. We will see how culture, politics and history play themselves out upon the stage of stadium and field, from fascist Italy to visionary Uruguay to indomitable Cameroon. We will see how the World Cup has become a catalyst for political and cultural debate, and how it has made, and destroyed, political regimes. And we will try to understand the game as others, in different times and places, have seen it: a game freighted with meaning and beauty","3461":"Many enlightenment authors expressed confidence in the relentless progress of knowledge, but they also exuded skepticism and unease about reason. New questions about nature and new approaches to studying it, unleashed fears about humanity\u2019s place in the world. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz worried that the specter of infinite time might eliminate the need for God; David Hume doubted the necessity of cause and effect; Immanuel Kant limited reason to make way for faith. Each of these writers used reason to question the religious and metaphysical foundations of knowledge. But reason also created its own fears. This course is about those fears and what lay behind them.","3462":"This course focuses on the history and writings of the Frankfurt School, the group of theorists associated with the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt. The Frankfurt School would become enormously important, especially as a foundation for what is now often (and somewhat uncritically) called \u201ccritical theory.\u201d This is an advanced seminar. Students will be expected to have some knowledge of the sources that Frankfurt School thinkers considered foundational, among them Kant, Marx, Weber, and Freud.","3463":"An introduction to selected major historians and subfields of history, Required of all history majors for graduation. Should be taken in junior year or first semester of senior year. Open to non-history majors with consent of instructor. May be repeated for credit.","3464":"An exploration of the shift in Western attitudes toward human life in the second half of the 19th century. Readings include Wells\u2019 Invisible Man, Stevenson\u2019s Jekyll and Hyde, Stoker\u2019s Dracula and Burroughs\u2019 Tarzan of the Apes.","3465":"A survey of the history of European philosophical thought from the time of the ancient Greeks to the middle ages. Readings include selections from the works of Plato, Aristotle and Boethius. Appropriate for all students.","3466":"A survey of the history of European philosophical thought from Shakespeare\u2019s time to the 1800s. Readings include selections from the works of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley and Hume. Appropriate for all students.","3467":"In the seventeenth century, developments in science and metaphysics revolutionized the way people perceived the world and wrote about it. This course will examine the revolution, focusing on the relation of metaphysics to poetry. Readings from Donne and others.","3468":"A look at three mystical and magical religious traditions: Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism.","3469":"A look at the practice and theory of the modern occult movement, with emphasis on \u201cThe Golden Dawn.\u201d Appropriate for all students.","3470":"A philosophical look at the nature of emotion in general and at the natures of the particular emotions of guilt, shame, embarrassment, anger, jealousy, and envy.","3471":"In this course, we will read several philosophical dialogs and examine the arguments in them, while asking the literary question of why their authors were attracted to this form. Readings will range from Plato\u2019s Euthyphro to John Perry\u2019s recent Dialog on Personal Identity and Immortality. ","3472":"An explanation of the evolution of detective fiction in relation to its changing historical and cultural context. Readings from Poe, Doyle, Christie, Hammitt, and Chandler.","3473":"This course will introduce students to the field of international and intercultural studies. The course objective is to acquaint students with key concepts and practices defining human societies and their relations, such as colonialism, development, revolution, national and transnational, globalization, ideology, identity, culture, and knowledge. The course also exposes students to disciplinary, area studies and newly emerging conceptualizations of the field.","3474":"This course surveys the modern history and political economy of natural resources. Though we will focus on gold, diamonds, and oil, the course also addresses larger issues of resource exploitation within specific historical, political, and economic settings. We begin with the so-called \u201cscramble for Africa,\u201d when European nations carved up Africa between them at Berlin Conference in 1885. This scramble for Africa and its resources was later extended to other regions of the non-western world, such as the Middle East. The course will then explore the role of natural resources in internal and global conflicts, from the colonial to the post-colonial periods, focusing on how those conflicts played themselves out in Africa and the Middle East.","3475":"Qigong is an ancient Chinese philosophy and practice. This course will have two major components: 1) history and theory of Qigong within Chinese culture, and 2) Qigong practice based on the Wei Tuo Eight Minute Drill that balances energy components of the human body for both physical and psychic health. Here the human ecology of the interaction between Qi energy in the natural environment and human beings will be investigated. This course will not only provide access to information and knowledge \u201cabout\u201d another culture, but also will provide an opportunity to experience how another culture accesses knowledge.","3476":"\u201cPower to the People!\u201d \u201cKnowledge is power.\u201d What does one mean by power, and how may altering power relations lead to social change? This course will critically examine different theories of power, the relationship between power and violence, and how power can be used to liberate as well as dominate and manipulate. Students will examine works from various interdisciplinary fields and movements, such as Marxism, feminism, postmodernism, anti-colonial and postcolonial movements, and indigenous and grassroots movements.","3477":"Designed as an introduction to theoretical debates central to interdisciplinary critiques of objectivist epistemology and methodologies, the course provides students with interdisciplinary methods for research and other knowledge practices. Students will be exposed to a range of alternative ways that interdisciplinary fields frame questions, conduct research and engage in action by challenging the political and ethical terms of the academy, muddying the fiction of the theory\/practice divide, exploring the kinds of theoretical, ideological, and material praxis that constitute interdisciplinary inquiry. Ethics, politics, epistemologies, authority, evidence, protocols, priorities, and feasibility will be discussed as students design a research project in interdisciplinary knowledge production to be used in External Studies independent study projects and\/or in senior projects.","3478":"Course examines historical and contemporary resistance to monocultural patters of knowledge and social relations supporting capitalist modernity. Resistance to monoculture has historically emerged from groups surviving the onslaught of monoculture, including women; the underclasses; and peoples of third worlds and first nations. The knowledge systems of these groups suggest how to practice constructive social change.","3479":"If justice occurs under the terms of the modern nation-state, then how is justice served for those violated by the nation-state: the colonized, refugees, outlawed social movements, and those who queer national norms? This course explores justice under the modern nation-state and forms of justice that interrogate the assumptions of the modern to work across social differences and introduce notions of justice from within and beyond Eurocentric rights, courts, and objectivity. Readings will be drawn from court cases, social movements, novels and indigenous narratives, parody and humor, feminist and queer performances, modern documents, and postmodern social theory.","3480":"An exploration of the ways in which resistance to colonization has shaped colonized peoples and colonizers alike past and present. Social movement websites, films analytical readings, and short fiction will survey various perspectives (Marxism, postmodernism, feminism, queer theory) on postcolonial studies. The course will introduce methods of constructing seemingly \u201cnatural\u201d objects (nation, landscape, historical fact, women) in ways that decolonize social and material relations and knowledge.","3481":"A survey of social and cultural critiques at an introductory level, this course will prepare students for advanced level critical thinking, interdisciplinary solution building and social change work. We will begin with theoretical frameworks in established fields of social critique, such as feminism, anti-colonialism, cultural studies, critical race theory, critical legal\/justice studies, and women of color theory. The course also introduces postmodern theories in postcolonial studies, poststructuralist feminism, post-Marxism, border studies and queer theory. Suitable for first- and second-year students, as well as upper level students who feel they have not yet been sufficiently exposed in their education to critical and\/or theoretical thinking.","3482":"The failure of colonial settlers to respect the land has resulted in global cultural and climate changes with large scale destructive impacts, including nearly complete devastation of indigenous subsistence and knowledge practices. This course introduces ways that Indigenous peoples past and present practice constructive, reciprocal relations with animal and plant inhabitants on the land, seas, and skies through readings and concrete practices. Meetings with indigenous community members practicing love for the land combined with field encounters with southern California native plants will open up ways to live out love for the land again. While the course focuses on California, students will also explore human-land relations in their own heritages and other sites.","3483":"The overall goal of this interdisciplinary course is to assist participants to develop intercultural competence especially intercultural sensitivity and cross-cultural research. The course will give students a skill set for conducting global\/local research on study abroad and the opportunity to gain a basic understanding of the role that culture plays in intercultural communication.","3484":"Students who plan to participate in the Costa Rica Summer Health Program are required to take this course during the spring semester immediately before their program. The seminar covers an introduction to epidemiology and health care in Costa Rica as well as units on history, environment, economy and politics, and a workshop on intercultural learning. Students are required to learn how to understand and analyze various sources of population and public health data, write a series of four short papers, give an oral presentation with an accompanying background paper, and complete a series of exercises dealing with the kinds of intercultural challenges they will likely confront during their homestays and internships in Costa Rica.","3485":"This is an intermediate course on theory, history, and practice of Wei Tuo QiGong. Students will study and practice the Shao Lin Tu Na exercises and meditation to better understand and experience the cultural and medical context of qi gong. Students will reflect upon the concepts of the mind\/body relationship, time, consciousness and dreams.","3486":"This seminar will study healing practices from around the world. It will include three aspects: 1) the philosophical, historical and political dimensions; 2) the local knowledge and theories of healing and illness in four traditions-Amerindian and Chinese and two from among the following: Mayan, African, Santeria, Curindera, Brazilian spiritualists, etc.; and 3) a review of the clinical efficacy of these complementary and alternative medicines provided by the Western biomedical sciences, as well as their political acceptance within the U.S.","3487":"This course analyzes the role of the state in the development process in Third World societies. It explores state policies toward rural development and industrialization, as well as socio-political forces which influence the implementation of development policies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.","3488":"This course explores the rise, the nature and the objectives of popular movements in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

In this course, the student will work on reinforcing basic skills in order to attain proficiency at an intermediate level. As a group, we also review some of the more complex aspects of the language, including preterit and imperfect, the subjunctive in all its forms, and the personal infinitive. The course emphasizes conversation during the class period, as well as readings related to the Brazilian cultural context and compositions where the students describe their own real life experiences in Portuguese.","3597":"This course is a pilot project based on the experience of creating a virtual learning community for linguistic and cultural exchange in Portuguese and English with students at the UFRJ in Brazil and The Claremont Colleges. Students will be paired up with a conversation partner with whom they will have weekly written and oral exchange in English and Portuguese. Students will be able to exchange emails and hold skype conversations on their own schedule. We will provide a curricular structure for the exchange, which will include exchange stages, platforms and activities stressing specific vocabulary and grammar. There will be room for students from both countries to share topics and materials according to their own needs and interests. The ultimate goal of the community is to improve oral proficiency in the target languages through a meaningful experience of exchange. All levels welcome.","3598":"What are we to make of divine silence in the face of human suffering? Why does it present a serious intellectual challenge to believe in God? How does one reconcile human suffering and divine hiddenness? What is the relation between divine hiddenness and the problem of evil? In this seminar, we set to address these questions and others by examining different philosophical perspectives that pertain to different theological traditions (mainly Jewish, Christian, and Islamic) and to nonbelievers. In addition, we explore different philosophical accounts of the concept of human suffering and its relation to human existence.","3599":"Students will study new voter engagement strategies, practices and theory from the Howard Dean, Obama, Sanders and Clinton campaigns and will do community engagement with organizations running grassroots voter engagement campaigns in the area. The class will be based on readings and research that has been carried out about voter engagement strategies. Reading and research will be supported by speakers working on local,statewide and national campaigns, both for candidates and non-partisan voter initiatives. Students will supplement classroom-based learning with hands on experience on concrete electoral campaigns. Students will choose from community engagement opportunities with local and statewide organizations working on voter engagement with strategies informed by the new left.","3600":"This course explores current movements, theories and narratives centered around critical issues in our local communities as well as focuses on theories and approaches to social service and social change and the tensions between them. The course will apply theory to practice through interdisciplinary scholarship, in-class dialogues, critical reflection and analysis, experiential learning, and direct engagement with local change-making organizations and movements. The course\u2019s theoretical frameworks are grounded in a cross section of disciplines, including contributions from cultural studies, critical education theory, psychology, sociology and anthropology. Course praxis (theory + action +critical reflection) will play out in large part through the program\u2019s intensive practicum, class fieldtrips and workshops that exemplify that which we study. Through this course, students will engage in hands-on applications of community-based education and become aware of local knowledge, assets, and approaches to social change.","3601":"This class explores community building, positionality, and social change through engagement with texts, interactive activities, guest speakers and field trips. We critically examine intersections between charity, service, social justice, activism, and academia through writing, discussion, and praxis.

Partnerships have been established with numerous organizations in the local area. 1.5 credits.","3602":"Research Methods for Community Change is an introduction to diverse approaches to qualitative inquiry, from ethnography to participatory action and project-based research. Our course combines a classic \u201ctoolkit\u201d approach to qualitative methods with the praxis of community-building and social change. We examine current debates, ethical dilemmas, and theoretical approaches to research in community settings. A distinctive and vital component of ONT105 is the intensive research internship and community immersion experience-a 125-hour commitment over the course of the semester. Students are partnered with grassroots organizations working to address issues that directly affect communities in the Inland Empire. Internship topics include immigration, education, incarceration, environmental justice, community health, and labor rights. In collaboration with a partner organization, students design and complete project- and community-based action research and share these as part of the culminating course assignment.","3603":"This course constructs the bride between academia and activism through practice-based research. The study of diverse aspects of qualitative inquiry culminates in the execution of a complete applied research project. We explore the role, responsibilities and ethics of an applied researcher, reviewing various types of inquiry that fall under the umbrella of qualitative research (i.e., ethnography, participatory action, narrative inquiry, participant-observation, applied research). Students directly impact not only their own intellectual knowledge base, but crucial social issues in the world around them. Students leave the course with a strong foundation to carry out systematic research using focus groups, ethnography and person-centered interviews. 1 credit.","3604":"This course focuses on the intersection of the healing arts, academia, and activism, bridging personal transformation and social change. The course\u2019s interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks (including cultural studies, feminist methodologies, indigenous studies, and social movement theory) offer diverse strategies for engaging the healing arts as a vehicle for self-realization and community empowerment. Students will engage in self-expression, self-discovery and community-building through creative writing, dance, music, art and meditation. Half of the course will take place on site at a local prison where students will engage in a shared educational journey with the inmates, thus exploring how our built environments (the prison and college campus) impact our resources, access and ability to negotiate practices for individual transformation and social change.","3605":"CASA 170 is designed to involve students in local social change movements. The course acts as a preparatory class for students who wish to take the full Ontario Program in a later semester, as a post-class for those who have already taken the program, or as a class in which students can test the waters of local community engagement. The course requires between 5-7 hours per week in Ontario Program internships at Huerta del Valle community garden and food hub, the Wheelhouse Bicycle Coalition, Inland Congregations United for Change education\/youth organizing, Warehouse Workers United labor organizing, Justice for Immigrants Coalition policy organizing, and Immigrant Youth Coalition youth organizing. The course examines different models and philosophies of organizing, building coalitions between higher education and community groups, and ethical ways of engaging in local environments around food, transportation, labor, education, and immigrant justice issues in the Inland Empire.","3606":"This course highlights life in organizations using a variety of theoretical lenses to explore important factors operating in this context. Students will investigate individual, social and societal influences present in organizations and apply knowledge gained from these studies to analyze relevant cases and better understand their own experience.","3607":"Think of theory as a lens or perspective that shapes how we understand the myriad ways in which people and institutions organize groups and work settings. Each theory simultaneously illuminates and obscures, shedding light on key features while overlooking others. Our goal is to apply theory to a variety of organizations, so theat we may \u2018see\u2019 and interpret them (and ourselves) in new and unexpected ways.","3608":"This course provides an overview of organizational theory, behavior and change and an introduction to several different leadership theories and pedagogies. During the course of the semester, students in the class will: a) explore and articulate their individual values and strengths as a leader; b) learn how to partner their strengths with others to enhance each other\u2019s leadership abilities; and c) act on their values and strengths to create meaningful and sustainable change in their communities.

March and his mentor Herbert Simon to the understanding of \u201chow decisions happen.\u201d We will discuss a variety of writings by March and his students, case studies, March\u2019s poetry, and illustrative films that draw on research and observation in many kinds of organizations.","3618":"Issues include the structure of large corporations and how they advance particular social, political and economic agendas; corporate strategies; how companies cope with industrial accidents, human rights, sustainability, ethical questions and the responsibilities of corporate boards.","3619":"College Inside-Out represents some of our greatest aspirations: to develop our passions, deepen our knowledge, find lasting friendships, give back to our families and communities, and, ultimately, land a good job doing what we love. College also represents some of our greatest challenges. As individuals, we may face anxiety, self-doubt, and isolation. As a community, diverse life experiences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and beliefs may clash, with no easy solutions. We are challenged when our aspirations are unmet and our imaginations unrealized. How can colleges craft responses to foster the promise of higher education\u2013from opportunity and social mobility to inclusion and pluralism? What more can and should be done? Through course materials, in conjunction with our own experiences and analysis, we will situate the institution of higher education within the broader context of American society, politics, and the economy. As part of our collective journey this semester, we will practice a variety of learning modalities, including student-driven discussion, informal in-class writing, formal (out-of-class) writing, and group projects. Throughout, we will practice knowledge construction as a communal process rooted in open dialog, thoughtful analysis, intellectual curiosity, and self-reflection. NOTE: This course is held at a level Il men\u2019s prison in Norco, CA. A required $15 course fee covers the cost of a whistle and t-shirt, to be worn during all class sessions.","3620":"This course will focus on understanding the educational system through the lens of organizational systems. Through the exploration of organizational literature and its application to current school issues, we hope to better understand the interconnected activities faced by the educational system.","3621":"This course is aimed at providing students with an opportunity to explore organizations as systems and managerial, technical, structural, and cultural subsystems as they relate to the broader environment. The course examines the interactions among human resources, technologies, organization design, external forces, and management practices from a macro-organization perspective thus providing the foundation for learning how to conduct a well-grounded organizational analysis. Building on diverse models of organizaion design and management, including mechanistic\/bureaucratic, human relations, political, open systems, complexity, and sustainability, analytical tools from each model will be introduced and practiced in a multi-contingency approach to organizational design.","3622":"With this course, students will examine scientific and technological changes in organizations in light of the econominc, cultural, and political systtems within which they have developed, asking: How do innovations take place? Why does one advancement earn prominence over others? What have been the repercussions of transformative breakthroughs? We will discuss scientific, systematic, and product design in particular.","3623":"Considers some of the theoretical and practical issues involved when people as individuals, groups, or organizations try to resolve disagreements. Areas considered include interpersonal and family conflict, legal dispute, contracts and public private collaborative arrangements arbitration, mediation, and forms of alternative dispute resolutions.

Our goal is to develop theoretical lenses for understanding the formal and informal organizations that undergird authoritarian regimes, as well as collective forces that may challenge them.","3626":"This seminar will introduce students to issues related to the creation and management of individual research projects leading to their senior thesis. Each student will propose, design and draft the initial sections of their thesis project and present their initial work at the end of the semester. Students enroll in ORST199 in the spring semester to complete their thesis.","3627":"What\u2019s so great about thinking and knowledge? In the course of the semester, we will investigate that value of a philosophical life by taking a journey through the history of Western philosophy, from Socrates & Plato to Sartre. Along the way, we will consider perennial philosophical questions about the nature of justice, the relationship between mind & body, free will, the problem of evil and arguments for the existence of God.","3628":"Introduction to some of the central issues regarding the nature of knowledge, the mind and reality. Topics to be discussed include skepticism, the analysis of knowledge, theories of epistemic justification, the nature of consciousness and subjectivity, mental causation, dualism, reductive and non-reductive physicalism, proofs for the existence of God, and personal identity.","3629":"Beginning with a review of Kant, German idealism (Fichte through Hegel), Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, and Derrida will be considered.","3630":"The philosophy of religion is concerned with philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief. In this course, we will examine how philosophers reflected upon religious themes such as the existence and nature of God, the problem of evil, faith and reason, religious experience, personal identity, immortality of the soul and death, and religious pluralism. The main goal of this course is to give students an opportunity to investigate substantive issues of religious nature and to assess the role that philosophical reflection plays in such an investigation.","3631":"In the past century, art has become interwoven with neoliberalism and late capitalism. Yet, some contend, artistic creation has never been the pure expression of individual genius, nor has the reception of art ever been immune to the influences of ideology. If artists are not independent self-knowers, but rather products of socially constructed effects of power, to what extent do they have control over their work? If objective certainty is a myth, how do we judge good art from bad? If the cult of the \u2018genius\u2019 is a product of patriarchy, how do we conceive of creative expression? How do forms of new media influence consciousness and political action? This course will consider these questions using twentieth-century and contemporary European philosophy, including post-structuralism, French feminism, and the Frankfurt School.","3632":"This course is a survey of the history of philosophy in the Islamic world. As a historical evolution of Greek Philosophy, Islamic philosophy synthesizes both the Aristotelian and the Post-Plotinian traditions in an independent way. From the ninth century to the present day, a set of philosophical topics has been systematically discussed and developed by philosophers in the Islamic world. We will discuss topics including the divine attribute and essence, the origin and the nature of the universe, the relation between philosophy and religion, the existence and faculties of the soul, the idea of the philosopher king, Skepticism, what is Islam, the concept of humanity in Islam, mysticism, the problem of good and evil, women and the Quran. Through selective readings of philosophical texts, we will introduce the main figures, including al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Averreos, al-Razi, Ibn Tufayl, Arkoun, Shari\u2019ati, Nasr Abu Zayd, and Amina Wadud.","3633":"An examination of philosophical reasoning pertaining to belief in, and the concept of God in the Monotheistic traditions","3634":"Contemporary Americans tend to take for granted that we have a \u2018self,\u2019 but a closer look reveals to most of us that we don\u2019t know what the self is. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear that there is such a thing as a self, and whether it is a necessary idea. In this course, we will consider a variety of theories of selfhood from the history of Anglo-European philosophy in order to put pressure on contemporary assumptions about selfhood. Thinkers studied will include Augustine, Montaigne, Butler, Foucault, James, and Taylor. The course will utilize philosophical and historical methods in order to analyze critically the ways that our present-day understandings of the self are conditioned by the past.","3635":"Ever since Darwin first posited a plausible mechanism for evolution, scientists and non-scientists alike have used his ideas to support their own concepts about the nature of human nature. In class, we will examine the history, concepts and philosophy behind Darwin\u2019s ideas, exploring in the process the fields of sociobiology, cognitive psychology, and primatology, among others. We will also consider the relationship between development and evolution as we attempt to build an understanding of Darwin\u2019s mechanism that is free of the confused notions that have become attached to it over the years.","3636":"Contemporary U.S. society praises the idea of \u2018self-care\u2019. Individuals are encouraged to care for themselves through expensive health regimens, self-help books, and quasi-spiritual practices, spurred by phrases such as \u201ctreat yourself\u201d and \u201cbe true to yourself.\u201d This course will consider the nature of self-care from ancient societies to the present day. Guiding questions include: Who am I, and how should I treat myself? What is the relation between self-care and self-knowledge? How is it possible to change or improve oneself, if at all? What does self-love look like? Does self-care promote the greater good of society or detract from it by promoting selfishness?","3637":"In this course we will examine the major theological\/philosophical traditions: the \u201crationalist\u201d and the \u201ctraditionalist,\u201d that emerged in early Islamic history and continues to exist to the present day. In the course of the examination, we will see how these two traditions FUNDAMENTALLY disagree on how to determine the nature of God, the status of the Quran, the significance of the prophetic tradition, and the roles of human reason on Muslim society. We will investigate these topics in the writings of thinkers from the classic period to the present-day, such as al-Ash\u2019ari, al-Baqilani, al-Qadi, al-Ghazali, Aricenna, Averroes, Ibn Taymiyyah \u2018Abd al-Wahab, etc.","3638":"What is the nature of the sensory modalities? If one were to posit a new, \u201csixth\u201d sense, what evidence","3639":"What is the nature of the sensory modalities? If one were to posit a new, \u201csixth\u201d sense, what evidence would be required to establish such a claim? How many senses are there and how many senses do \u201cnormal\u201d humans have? What is the sensory life of those who have more or fewer senses than the average, neurotypical person? This will be an interdisciplinary exploration, touching on philosophy, history of science, sensory anthropology, sensory psychology, neurobiology and the study of artificial senses (cyborgs). In addition to writing assignments, there will also be hands-on engagement with the senses in a lab session each wee","3640":"In this course we will investigate some core topics in Western Modern Philosophy by examining the thoughts of Spinoza (1632-1677) and Leibniz (1646-1716). We will be introduced to the central metaphysical, epistemological, and moral claims of Spinoza and Leibniz through reading primary texts. Claims pertaining to the nature and the constitution of reality, the problem of infinity and unity, the existence of non-physical entities, e.g., God, the free will problem, the mind-body Problem, and the theory of causation. We will address questions such as: What is the nature of the universe? Is its existence necessary? Are the laws of nature causally or logically necessary? Do humans exercise free will? What is the relation between God and the universe?","3641":"Students work individually with faculty to identify an area of interest and define a topic to investigate. The research project results in a thesis to be submitted in writing to the Philosophy Department.","3642":"An introduction to the study of politics and its subfields of political philosophy and U.S. politics.

The course explores how different peoples, classes, cultures and nations organize themselves politically for common purposes and for addressing conflicts. Required of Political Studies majors; also serves as an appropriate course for other students interested in politics.","3644":"This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US Constitution and shaping the nation\u2019s politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy.","3645":"This introductory course focuses on explaining political events and processes- like civil war, regime change, revolution, and development- that we regularly read and hear about in the news. Empirically, the course deals with a variety of countries, including those in which Pitzer has study abroad and international exchange programs.","3646":"This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the history and theory of international politics. The course is divided into three roughly equal-sized sections. The first section offers an introduction to the two philosophical\/theoretical traditions in international relations thought: rationalism (and its realist and liberal variants) and social constructivism (and its statist and global variants). The second section covers a series of significant periods in international political history from the emergence of the modern system of states in Europe in the sixteenth century to the end of the Cold War. The third section investigates various issues in contemporary international politics.","3647":"The study of political philosophy focuses on broad assumptions concerning human nature and the character of community organizations that regulate activities and seek to promote happiness. These assumptions, structures and goals vary through time and across cultures. This class examines the texts of major theorists representing European, Chinese, Islamic, and Indian political thought and compares their arguments concerning the nature of freedom, justice, equality, authority and responsibility among other fundamental concepts.","3648":"This course provides an overview of the processes and politics of policy-making in the United States. We will explore normative issues of equity and efficiency, consider advantages and disadvantages of policy-making in different venues (courts, legislatures, bureaucracies) and explore the different perspectives on the policy-making held by various actors.","3649":"This course explores the methods employed in political studies research. The two primary goals of the course are: 1) to provide new analytic tools that will help in the critical evaluation of social science material; and 2) to improve students\u2019 ability to pose and answer research questions on their own.","3650":"What is justice? This seemingly simple question has elicited complex responses. Based on their notions of social and political justice, people have developed laws, formed institutions, created political communities, and waged wars. In this seminar, we explore the implications of these debates for contemporary political communities in local and global contexts. Questions include: what makes a political, moral, social or religious order just? Are there certain principles of justice that people across cultural and political boundaries agree upon? How can these debates help us become more informed, engaged, and responsible citizens in our respective communities?","3651":"Applied Urban Politics I (fall semester) and Applied Urban Politics II (spring semester) are sequenced courses designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of city\/urban politics through course content and internships with government agencies in Pomona, California.","3652":"This class addresses why individuals participate in U.S. elections, the factors that influence their voting decisions, and the role of campaigns in this process.

The class is divided into four sections. In the first section, we examine women\u2019s movements and developments in women\u2019s rights from legal, historical, and political perspectives. The second section explores women\u2019s political behavior including attitudes, voting patterns, and campaign strategies. The third section addresses women as political office holders and includes discussions of how women approach representation and policy formation. In this section, we consider \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d and investigate how certain policies affect women. The final section consists of student presentations on their term paper research. Throughout the course, we will explore such themes as the relationship (or lack thereof) between substantive and descriptive representation, the intersections between gender politics and racial and ethnic politics, and the status of women under law (de jure) and in practice (de facto). This course is cross-listed with Gender and Feminist Studies.","3654":"This course explores problems at the forefront of American politics, with an emphasis on active political participation. Questions include: How sould young people practice politics? Has civic participation become debilitated? Should we just poll people instead of holding elections? Should there be a military draft? Why are corporations so powerful?","3655":"This module of the campaign and parties practicum prepares students to undertake internships in a political party or electoral campaign over the summer.

We will look at opinions across a range of policy areas, and learn how to design surveys and do basic analyses of public opinion data.","3661":"This class applies the theories and strategies on voter mobilization to the context of the Inland Empire in California. The IE which consists of San Bernardino and Riverside counties has a population of over 4 million, making it second to Los Angeles County as the most populous area in the state. From the political landscape, it is evident that Latinos, immigrants and other minority groups are severely underrepresented.

This course examines Britain\u2019s kaleidoscopic national identities - European, British, English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh - through their representation in popular culture and their place in the nations\u2019 politics.","3664":"Modern South Asia has emerged as a dynamic and yet deeply troubled part of the world. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the basic themes that define contemporary South Asian politics: including, religion and religious violence, terrorism and insurgency, democracy and its discontents, authoritarianism and resistance, power and authority, diversity and nationalism, and status, heirarchy and equality.","3665":"Surfing and the Politics of Race, Class and Culture: The purpose of this course is to examine how surfing has intersected with such forces as colonialism, capitalism, race and gender roles, the military industrial complex, and globalization. Much of the surfing\u2019s romantic image is a myth. In this course, we will go beyond the myths developed by Hollywood and corporations to examine its true historical origins and its evolution in places like California, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil.","3666":"This course examines popular representations of Latinos in media and the social consequences of those representations. American films, television shows and print media are the primary ways citizens learn about politics, social issues and out-groups. Latino images and popular narratives profoundly impact how they are perceived and treated by out-groups. At best, Latinos are seen as an \u201cinvisible community\u201d because of their underrepresentation in the media. Yet, when they are portrayed, the images and narratives tend to be narrow and negative. These representations have contributed to the criminalization and victimization of Latinos.","3667":"This course examines the contemporary politics of Latin America. It explores the transformation of the region\u2019s politics in the late twentieth century; the different governing coalitions that have come to power as a result of that transformation; the policies implemented by those different coalitions; the effects of these policies on everyday life in Latin America; and the emergence of political resistance across much of the region.","3668":"This is a course about the possible connections between religion and violence, focused particularly on organized armed conflict. This is a topic that has received, surprisingly, very little sustained attention from social science literatures and the main purpose of the course is to explore what the contours of a theory of religion and violence would like. The course is organized around major historical and theoretical monographs (a book a week) designed to structure class discussions and the course is, therefore, reading intensive. The readings have been designed to give students a sense of what answers historians and social scientists have given to the puzzle of religion and violence while stimulating the participants to ask provocative questions.","3669":"This course provides an overview of China\u2019s political system. It begins with a brief historical overview of China\u2019s political development since 1949. The remainder of the course examines the industrial features of the current political system and the key challenges facing the CCP leadership, focusing on the prospects for political for political reform. By applying concepts and theories in comparative politics, we will investigate important issues in Chinese politics, including political selection, state-business relations, protests movements, political participation, public opinion, and media and Internet control.
