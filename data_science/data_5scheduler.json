But while chaos has its own rules and symmetries and nothing is coincidental or happens by chance, as spectators we are complicit in the occurrences of violent upheaval about which we read each day in The New York Times. We will investigate this premise. How do we explain war; what is it for? What does war do to us—distant or not-so-distant spectators—and to others—willing or unwilling participants? Is war endemic to the human condition? Is it a necessary evil? Does it emerge from psychologi­cal and irrational “drives,” or from economic, rational considerations?

Does it mean anything, to say that you are thinking rationally? This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, “scientific rationality”—as we will call it for the moment—is “located.” What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compel­ling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps “at work” even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer these questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic—the elements of “scientific rationality.” Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for “us” what is “irrational.” Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that “do” science act, think and make knowledge.","source":"HarveyMudd","credits":300,"instructors":["de Laet"],"offered":"Offered alternate years","prerequisites":"Any introductory course in anthropology or any introductory course in science, technology, and society","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"A History of Landscape Photography","identifier":"ARHI-131-HM","description":"This course explores how photographic landscape imagery has shaped our experience and ideas of the land.

Other letters are official government documents that provide otherwise inaccessible details about the ancient economy and government administration. Moreover, letters were understood to be gifts that enriched the lives and status of recipients.

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay and uses films alongside readings to explore each unit’s key topics.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Cecile Traore"],"offered":"Spring 2020.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":true,"fee":0},{"title":"Archaeological Theory","identifier":"ANTH-101-PO","description":"Archaeology is one of the four primary subdivisions of Anthropology.

That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the “writing on the walls of the prison house of culture,” a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a “matter of life and death.” We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation. Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film your own essay.

The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists’ inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Megan D.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over ‘illegality’ further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["A.

Why do some policies fail? The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution. Instead, the objective of this course is to develop some habits of mind that enable the students see the world of politics through the analytical lens of economics. .","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["M.

Tracing Ovid’s narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of “affordance” encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the “vivid” style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["C.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an “unfinished event?” The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: “she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son’s rhythm is different.” A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called “How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces.” At the heart of the course was Barthes’ concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of “individual rhythms” that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes’ notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: “spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living.” How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we’ll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to “content.” Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory.

This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women’s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Skyler Reidy"],"offered":"Last offered spring 2017.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":true,"fee":0},{"title":"James Joyce","identifier":"ENGL-161-PO","description":"Examinations of Joyce’s works: Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, Exiles and Ulysses.

And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere ‘throughout history, and across the globe’ they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. (‘Essay,’ from the French verb ‘essai,’ to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create ‘strange bridges’ where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form’s origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay’s protean potential to the fullest.

What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Maria Prokopenko","Jade-Star Lackey"],"offered":"Last offered spring 2020.","prerequisites":"ENGL 067 PO","corequisites":"","currently_offered":true,"fee":0},{"title":"Ralph Ellison","identifier":"ENGL-170C-PO","description":"This interdisciplinary course focuses on the writings of Ralph Ellison as a cornerstone of the African American literary tradition, and as a theorist whose literary work, theoretical engagements, and cultural criticism helped lay the foundations of the Civil Rights Movement, African Diaspora theory, Afrofuturism, Afropessimism, and Afropunk.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["V.

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a ‘nonfiction novel’ in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of ‘autofiction’)? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel’s tradition, given the form’s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped; guiding policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions. These sophisticated tools for modeling complex socio-spatial relationships are continually simplified with easy- to-follow drop-down menus and of-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications, expanding the user-base of map-makers. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps to reveal hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world.

However, the century-long positive perceptions gave way to a more negative and hostile view of the US in the Middle East since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America’s earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the ‘binge model’ of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form.

Students will be encouraged to develop a critical and political consciousness around historical formations of black identity, their own participation in embracing and/or resisting black representations, and the impact of black popular culture on their lived experiences. The course will be structured as a seminar and will emphasize collaborative thinking and discussion. Each class will feature a media component, a brief lecture putting the assigned media and readings into context, followed by collective discussion and contribution.

This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term “horror,” and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? . Letter grade only.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["K.

Our focus will center mainly upon Hollywood cinema’s depiction of warfare, but the course also expands beyond American borders to explore the genre in a global context. While the Hollywood war film can often serve as a platform for glorifying armed conflict and celebrating the heroism of the combatant, it has also historically been a site of political and ideological critique, and has served as a barometer of the social mood and public perception of warfare. Throughout the semester we will examine representations of war in cinema across the 20th century and into the 21st century, tracking its impact and its aftermath at the level of the political and social, but also at the level of the subjective and the psychological. We will develop the critical and theoretical frameworks necessary to grapple with aesthetics of violence, reading work from Prince, Massumi, Baurillard, Virilio, Foucault, and Scarry, among others. Topics will include, torture, preemption, genocide, trauma, deterrence, revenge, reintegration and forgiveness. Letter grade only.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["K.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example. Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community.

During the semester, we will read all the novellas that have been adapted for the screen by Pier Paolo Pasolini (Decameron, 1971), and the Taviani brothers (Magnifico Boccaccio, 2015) identifying the challenges that such a classical Italian work presents to Italian filmmakers in their attempts to transcribe it into an audiovisual spectacle. By reading and analyzing a large selection of Boccaccio's one hundred novelle, and watching and examining their corresponding filmic transpositions, we will address notions and problems of language, style, structure and content for each novella, together with the techniques of transposition of the written text to the movie screen.","source":"Scripps","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Italian Literature of Gastronomy","identifier":"ITAL-145-SC","description":"The year 2020 marks the two hundredth anniversary of Pellegrino Artusi's birth, author of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), the most prominent and famous Italian cookbook in the history of gastronomy. However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen. Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining \"Italianess\", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.","source":"Scripps","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Special Topics in Italian","identifier":"ITAL-197-SC","description":"Specific course information available in pre-registration materials.","source":"Scripps","credits":100,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"ITAL 044  or equivalent.","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Independent Study in Italian Literature: Reading and Research","identifier":"ITAL-199-SC","description":"Course Credit: 1.0Offered: Every year","source":"Scripps","credits":100,"instructors":[],"offered":"Every year","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Introductory Latin","identifier":"LATN-001-SC","description":"Students will learn the basics of Latin grammar and syntax along with some aspects of ancient Roman culture and literature.

After exploring how Western expansion and imperialism affected the domestic development of countries in the region, we transition to the Middle East since World War I, examining the emergence of nationalism and nation-states, the origins and future of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the role of ethnic and religious minorities in political affairs. We then analyze the rise of political Islam, the Middle East since 9/11, and US presence in the region. We will conclude by exploring the recent popular protests in the Arab world and their implications for the fate of the region in the 21st century. Along the way, we ask questions such as these: How did increasing interactions with the West and emerging global trade since the 18th century influence the social and political structures of countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Iran? Why did nationalism and state formation differ from country to country in the region?

The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and yet something many Jewish Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo - and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course, we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom - and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Palestine and Israel.","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals","identifier":"HIST-100AK-PO","description":"","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Crusade and Jihad","identifier":"HIST-100WX-PO","description":"","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Ancient Life in Letters","identifier":"HIST-106-CM","description":"","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","currently_offered":false,"fee":0},{"title":"Energy and Humanity: Past, Present and Future","identifier":"HIST-112-PZ","description":"This course starts by examining the energy regime of mobile-foraging, sedentary-farming, and industrial models of livelihood, as these modes of livelihood are found distributed across the earth and through human time, starting some 100,000 years ago.

And too, this section of the course challenges students to investigate how each College in the consortium is a “complicit institution” in the current inhumane energy regime. For the final section of the course, students must carefully plan and initiate an activist intervention that addresses and redresses the perils of fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy.

Consequently, should America be a religious or secular nation? The extent to which we inhabit a Christian nation is one of the most ubiquitous (and shrill) debates in contemporary American politics. Central to this debate is the religious (or not-so religious) intentions behind our so-called Founding Fathers, and their plans for our nation’s religious establishment. For some, the Founders were pious and devout men intent on constructing an explicitly Christian nation; for others, they were borderline atheists who envisioned a strict separation of church and state. The historical reality is much more complex than either side readily admits. Burdened by anachronism and oversimplification, this debate is in dire need of thoughtful historical exploration from several angles. This is the work we will perform in this course. We will not only examine and contextualize the complex, conflicting, and often changing views of the Founders themselves, but we will also trace the evolution of this debate from the Revolution to the present. How and why has the struggle over religion in politics taken the form that it has?

We follow him from the quiet German towns and idealist philosophy of his youth, to the great revolutionary metropolis of mid-century Paris, to the blaring factories of industrial Manchester and up through the unification of Germany.

Yet, what do we mean by a good education? What literacy practices are privileged? And how do race, class, geography, and gender influence access? In this writing seminar, we investigate the cultural and communicative practices that define literacy in different educational settings. We begin by analyzing the literacy autobiographies of public intellectuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Mike Rose, before composing our own narratives about other people, perspectives, and institutions that have shaped our sense of ourselves as writers. Next, we draw on research from sociology, writing studies, and linguistics to reassess problematic representations of literacy in education policies and popular culture. For a capstone project, students write op-eds on an issue in education or literacy that interests them.
